ActionBarSherlock
-----------------

You will need the ActionBarSherlock library, which in turn requires the "android support" library.

The code was tested with ABS 4.4.0 and support library revision 10.

NOTE: ABS will not compile with the v4 support library rev. 23! We are in the process of migrating from ABS to AppCompat however this hasn't been completed yet!! If you need to build now, you need a older revision library, likely pre-22.1 (for other compatibility reasons).

See https://github.com/MarcusWolschon/osmeditor4android/issues/354 and https://github.com/MarcusWolschon/osmeditor4android/issues/305

You can find the android support lib in your SDK folder in one of:

extras/android/compatibilty/v4
extras/android/support/v4

Link the JAR into the libs folder in Eclipse.
You may need to replace the outdated version in the ActionBarSherlock project with a current link.

I have also included the annotations.jar from android-sdk/tools/support, I don't know if it's required.

ActionBarSherlock can be obtained at https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock/ or http://actionbarsherlock.com/
You need to import the ActionBarSherlock project into your workspace and set it up as a prerequisite for Vespucci.
(the JAR alone is NOT sufficient)

There is a known issue (#208) with ActionBarSherlock: https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock/issues/208
This is also being tracked in Vespucci issue #114: https://github.com/MarcusWolschon/osmeditor4android/issues/114
For the moment, you will need to modify your local copy of ActionBarSherlock as per the comment from "lodlock" in
the ABS issue.

Vespucci will hang on start up in getSystemService explicitly disabling Accelerometer, Magnetic field and Orientation sensors will workaround the issue.
