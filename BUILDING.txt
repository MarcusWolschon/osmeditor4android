ActionBarSherlock
-----------------

There is a known issue (#208) with ActionBarSherlock: https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock/issues/208
This is also being tracked in Vespucci issue #114: http://code.google.com/p/osmeditor4android/issues/detail?id=114
For the moment, you will need to modify your local copy of ActionBarSherlock as per the comment from "lodlock" in
the ABS issue.

Vespucci will hang on start up in getSystemService explicitly disabling Accelerometer, Magnetic field and Orientation sensors will workaround the issue.
