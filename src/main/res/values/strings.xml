    <string name="welcome_title">Welcome</string>
    <string name="welcome_message">Thank you for installing Vespucci.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vespucci is a powerful tool for editing OpenStreetMap.
        It supports nearly everything on mobile that you can accomplish with a desktop editor, this however comes with a certain level of complexity. 
        The help pages on the device or online will answer most questions, if you need more support we recommend asking on Openstreetmaps community forum.
        &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To get started you need to know three things:
        &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;tapping the lock icon in the upper left corner will switch between locked (no editing) and unlocked mode.
        &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;to add a new object tap the large green button and select what you want to add from the menu, then tap the position you want to locate it at.
        &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;to open the nearby point of interest display drag the handle above the bottom menu bar up.
        &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
        On the next page you can set some initial preferences that will make your journey with Vespucci more pleasant. 
    </string>
    <string name="welcome_settings_tab_text">To improve your initial experience we can configure some options right now,
        you can skip this step and set individual preferences later if you want to.
    </string>
    <string name="welcome_use_imagery_text">Display aerial imagery\nfor your current location</string>
    <string name="welcome_use_imagery_explanation">Aerial imagery sources are provided by third parties and it is unavoidable 
        that they can access your current network address and the location you are viewing. If you have privacy concerns don\'t 
        select this and we will display the standard OpenStreetMap map as the background.
    </string>
    <string name="welcome_auto_download_text">Automatically download data</string>
    <string name="welcome_auto_download_explanation">"Automatically downloading OpenStreetMap data can cause significant mobile traffic.
        If you are using a metered connection you might prefer to not enable this and manually download data for the area you want to work on.
    </string>
    <string name="welcome_pen_setup_text">Configure for pen or mouse usage</string>
    <string name="welcome_pen_setup_explanation">If you are using a pen, a mouse or other pointing device, 
        selecting this option will make editing more efficient.
    </string>
    <string name="welcome_authorize_text">Authorize now</string>
    <string name="welcome_authorize_explanation">You need to authorize Vespucci to upload to your OpenStreetMap account. 
        If you have your login and password handy you can start that automatically when you have completed this form, 
        otherwise the process will start automatically the first time you upload edits.

    <string name="tip_imagery_privacy">Background and overlay layers are provided by third parties. Using a layer transmits your network address and a rough indication of the area you are looking at to the provider.&lt;p&gt;If the provider has supplied privacy policy information, you can view it with the \"Info\" menu item in the layer dialog.</string>

    <string name="tip_panoramax_privacy">Panoramax is a service provided by third parties, the default server is operated by OpenStreetMap France, however you can change the server in the preferences. Using the service transmits your network address and information on which images you have viewed to the operator.</string>
    <string name="tip_pan_and_zoom_auto_download">Pan and zoom auto download should be used with caution as it has the potential to severely tax both the OpenStreetMap APIs and your device.&lt;p&gt;The load on the API servers can be avoided by using an offline data source.</string>
    <string name="tip_locked_mode">In locked mode you can\'t edit, but a long press on an object will open a display with detailed information.</string>
    <string name="tip_longpress_simple_mode">In simple mode a long press will not do anything. Turn simple mode off in the main menu if you want to use long clicks to create objects.</string>
    <string name="tip_gpx_no_elevation">Starting with version 15, GPX tracks no longer contain elevation information by default.&lt;p&gt;To enable elevation recording, install a Geoid model with &lt;i&gt;Install EGM&lt;/i&gt; from the Tools menu, or switch to NMEA input.</string>
    <string name="tip_tag_conflict">Merging and reversing OSM elements sometimes requires changing attributes on the elements, if there is a potential error or conflict you are alerted to this and are offered an opportunity to review the objects in question.</string>
    <string name="tip_replace_geometry">Replacing the geometry of a way often requires moving the position of existing nodes, if these are tagged, that is they represent objects themselves, this might be undesireable.&lt;p&gt;To avoid this problem we extract nodes that are not within a small tolerance radius from the parent way and display a warning. You can adjust the tolerance (default 1m) in the advanced preferences.</string>
    <string name="tip_gpx_recording">When you start GPX recording Vespucci collects location data to enable the GPX recording even when the app is not visible.&lt;p&gt;Explicitly closing the application or turning GPX recording off will stop the use of location data in such situations.</string>
    <string name="tip_auto_download">When you start auto-downloading OSM data or tasks Vespucci utilizes location data to determine the current position even when the app is not visible.&lt;p&gt;Explicitly closing the application or turning auto-downloading off will stop the use of location data in such situations.</string>
    <string name="tip_tristate_checkbox">You just touched a tristate checkbox, these work just as normal checkboxes, toggling between two values, for example yes/no or true/false.&lt;p&gt;However they have an additional third &lt;b&gt;not set&lt;/b&gt; state, indicated by a greyed out checkbox which will stop the corresponding tag from being added. You can set the checkbox to this state with a long press.</string>
    <string name="tip_alternative_tagging">You just applied a preset that has links to alternative tagging. That is other ways to tag this object that may be more appropriate or may simply be related. These alternative presets will be shown at the top of the most recently used preset display.</string>
    <string name="tip_mode_switching">The lock button doubles as the mode switcher, a long press will show a menu with the different options.&lt;p&gt;You can find more information about Vespucci\'s modes in the help system, both in the introduction and the help for the main map display.</string>
    <string name="tip_empty_gpx_download">Due to a quirk in the OSM API the starting point of the GPX track needs to be in view for it to be found for download.</string>
    <string name="tip_no_redo">This mode currently doesn\'t support redoing node additions.</string>
    <string name="tip_way_splitting">Touch a highlighted node to determine the split position. A long touch will allow you to select which part is used for the new way in a further step.</string>
    <string name="tip_closed_way_splitting">A closed way has to be split in two places. Touch a highlighted node to determine the 1st split position, the next step will ask you to select the 2nd position.</string>
    <string name="tip_disambiguation_menu">When multiple OSM elements or other objects are very close together or elements are members of relations the disambiguation menu will be displayed. You can then select the specific element from the list.&lt;p&gt;If an element is currently already selected it will be highlighted.</string>
    <string name="tip_file_import">On devices running Android 10 or later we need to copy files to be able to access them fully. The copies are located in &lt;i&gt;Downloads/Vespucci/imports&lt;/i&gt;. If necessary you can delete the originals and just retain the copies.</string>
    <string name="tip_wms_tile_size">WMS servers can support larger tile sizes than 256x256, consider using 512x512 for a more efficient configuration.</string>
    <string name="tip_empty_comment_warning">Vespucci always adds an automatically created summary of what you uploaded.&lt;p&gt;You should still consider adding a few words on why you are making the edits to provide more context for other mappers.</string>
    <string name="tip_wikimedia_filename">Always use a descriptive and unique filename, in particular not a camera generated one or else Wikimedia will reject the upload.</string>
