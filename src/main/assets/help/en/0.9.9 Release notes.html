<h1>Vespucci 0.9.9 Highlights</h1><h2>Indoor Mode</h2><p>Long pressing the lock icon will cycle through</p>
<ul>
  <li>Normal editing mode</li>
  <li>Tag only mode</li>
  <li>Indoor editing mode</li>
</ul><p>In indoor mode the displayed level can be changed with the up/down buttons, tapping the level display button will show everything that doesn’t have a level tag (roughly, it is slightly more complicated than that). </p><h2>Changed "Geometry Improvement Handle" behaviour</h2><p>Geometry improvement handles on ways now work as they do with iD: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Select way</li>
  <li>Drag handle (default rendering is a red x)</li>
  <li>Way remains selected</li>
  <li>Drag handle</li>
  <li>.. and so on ...</li>
</ul><p>The tradeoff is that now more care has to be exercised when dragging ways.</p><h2>Tag based filter</h2><p>The filter can be enable from the normal main menu, the filter can then be changed by tapping the filter icon.</p><p>The full change log is available here https://github.com/MarcusWolschon/osmeditor4android/commits/master </p><h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<ul>
  <li>the "Find" search function now supports Photon based geocoders. The default configuration of the OSMF Nominatim and komoots Photon instances can be changed in the advanced preferences.</li>
</ul><h1>Known Problems</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Due to a change in the way Android N handles Uri that reference on device files currently photos that are not in the Vespucci folder cannot be displayed by clicking on them in the photo layer.</li>
</ul><h1>Upgrading from previous Versions</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The saved editing state file format has changed, please complete any edits before upgrading.</li>
  <li>For known problems with the beta build please see https://github.com/MarcusWolschon/osmeditor4android/issues</li>
