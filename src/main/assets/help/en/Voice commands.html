<h1>Voice commands</h1>
<p>Vespucci has rudimentary and highly experimental support for adding objects via voice commands. To be used the support needs to be enabled in the advanced preferences &quot;Experimental&quot; section.</p>
<ul>
<li>in &quot;New&quot; mode (long press), plus tapping the microphone icon: a name (example &quot;McDonalds&quot;) or a preset name, either in English (or in German), (example: &quot;Butcher&quot; or &quot;Fleischer&quot; or &quot;Fleischer Schmidt&quot;) or a number (&quot;twentytwo&quot;) will create a node of the corresponding kind or an address. Essentially it uses the same search as the normal preset search and will use the first result found.</li>
<li>in locked mode tap the main screen , available commands are
<ul>
<li>&quot;map&quot; or in German &quot;hier&quot; followed by a term as above, a node with the corresponding terms will be created at the current GPS position (which is less useful than you think)</li>
<li>&quot;note&quot; or in German &quot;notiz&quot; followed by text will create a note at the current GPS position with the text as content</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: the facility uses googles voice recognition framework which requires a working network connection</p>
