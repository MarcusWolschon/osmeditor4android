<h1 id="node-selected">Node selected</h1>
<p>Node selection is described in the <a href="../en/Introduction.md">Introduction</a>. Selected nodes can be moved by dragging in the touch area, you can enable a large drag area in the preferences. You can edit tags for selected nodes.</p>
<h2 id="actions">Actions</h2>
<p>Note: some of these actions will only be visible if they can actually be executed on the selected node. For example you can only merge a node with a way or node if the selected node is in their tolerance zone.</p>
<h3 id="undo-undo"><img src="../images/undolist_undo.png" alt="Undo" /> Undo</h3>
<p>Tapping the icon once will undo the last operation. A long press will display a list of the operations since the last save, if you have undone anything a corresponding &quot;redo&quot; action will be displayed. If the undo results in the current selected object being removed you will be returned to the main screen. <em>Some operations consist of multiple simpler actions that will be listed as individual items.</em></p>
<h3 id="properties-properties"><img src="../images/tag_menu_tags.png" alt="Properties" /> Properties</h3>
<p>Starts the property editor on the current selection.</p>
<h3 id="todos-todos"><img src="../images/tag_menu_bug.png" alt="Todos" /> Todos</h3>
<p>If the selected element is associated either with a todo or osmose task this menu will be displayed.</p>
<p>Available actions are</p>
<h4 id="close-and-goto-next">Close and goto next</h4>
<p>Close a todo associated with the element and goto the nearest open todo in the list. If the element is present in multiple todo list a modal will ask which one to choose.</p>
<h4 id="skip-and-goto-next">Skip and goto next</h4>
<p>Skip a todo associated with the element and goto the nearest open todo in the list. If the element is present in multiple todo list a modal will ask which one to choose.</p>
<h4 id="close-all">Close all</h4>
<p>Close all todos and osmose bugs associated with the element.</p>
<h3 id="address-add-address-tags"><img src="../images/address.png" alt="Address" /> Add address tags</h3>
<p>Adds address tags with prediction. If the node is part of a building way it will further add &quot;entrance=yes&quot; if not present.</p>
<h3 id="append-append"><img src="../images/tag_menu_append.png" alt="Append" /> Append</h3>
<p>Add to the way this node is part of. The &quot;Append&quot; action is only available if the node in question is an end node of a way.</p>
<h3 id="unjoin-unjoin"><img src="../images/tag_menu_split.png" alt="Unjoin" /> Unjoin</h3>
<p>If a way node is selected that is a member of multiple ways this will create additional nodes at the location and use them instead of the original node in the ways.</p>
<h3 id="merge-merge"><img src="../images/tag_menu_merge.png" alt="Merge" /> Merge</h3>
<p>Merge the selected node with a way (as a new way node) or with an existing node. To make this tool appear in the toolbar, select a node and move it next to a way. If there are multiple possible target nodes or ways a disambiguation context menu will be shown.</p>
<h3 id="extract-extract-node"><img src="../images/extract_node.png" alt="Extract" /> Extract node</h3>
<p>Extract the selected node from all ways that it is a member of and replace it with a newly created one without any tags at all. The original node retains all tags and relation memberships and remains selected. After extracting, drag the original node to its new position. The above might seem very confusing but in the end the new mode is in the original place and the original node is in the new place!</p>
<h3 id="turnrestriction-add-turn-restriction"><img src="../images/no_left_turn_light.png" alt="TurnRestriction" /> Add turn restriction</h3>
<p>Start creating a turn restriction with this node as &quot;via&quot; member. This action is only available if the node in question is a potential via member, that is it is a member of at least two ways that have a &quot;highway&quot; tag. Ways will be split automatically during the process.</p>
<h3 id="rotate-rotate"><img src="../images/ic_menu_rotate.png" alt="Rotate" /> Rotate</h3>
<p>If the node has a direction tag with a degree value, rotate the node by dragging the display roughly in a circle.</p>
<h3 id="copy-copy"><img src="../images/ic_menu_copy_holo_light.png" alt="Copy" /> Copy</h3>
<p>Copy the node to the internal copy and paste buffer.</p>
<h3 id="duplicate-duplicate"><img src="../images/content_duplicate_light.png" alt="Duplicate" /> Duplicate</h3>
<p>Create a copy of the selected node in the same location. This does not utilize the copy and paste buffer.</p>
<h3 id="cut-cut"><img src="../images/ic_menu_cut_holo_light.png" alt="Cut" /> Cut</h3>
<p>Move the node to the internal copy and paste buffer removing it from the data.</p>
<h3 id="paste-tags">Paste tags</h3>
<p>Set tags from the internal tag clipboard and start the property editor.</p>
<h3 id="delete-delete"><img src="../images/tag_menu_delete.png" alt="Delete" /> Delete</h3>
<p>Remove the object from the data.</p>
<h3 id="extend-extend-selection"><img src="../images/extend_selection.png" alt="Extend" /> Extend selection</h3>
<p>Start Multi-Select mode with the current selected element.</p>
<h3 id="relation-create-relation"><img src="../images/relation.png" alt="Relation" /> Create relation</h3>
<p>Create a relation and add this object as the first element. The relation type can be selected from a list generated from the available presets. Further objects can be added until the check button is clicked, then the tag editor will be started on the new relation.</p>
<h3 id="add-to-relation">Add to relation</h3>
<p>Select a relation and add this object as a member. Further objects can be added until the check button is clicked, then the tag editor will be started on the relation.</p>
<h3 id="position-position"><img src="../images/menu_gps.png" alt="Position" /> Position</h3>
<p>Manually set longitude and latitude values for the coordinates of this node.</p>
<h3 id="info-info"><img src="../images/tag_menu_mapfeatures.png" alt="Info" /> Info</h3>

<h3 id="replace-geometry">Replace geometry</h3>
<p>Move the tags of current node to a (in a second step) selected way and merge the current node in to one of the target ways to preserve history.</p>
<h3 id="add-new-image">Add new image</h3>
<p>Start the camera app and upload the resulting image, adding an appropriate tag to the OSM element. Currently Panoramax and Wikimedia Commons targets are supported, you do need to configure and authorize access to the servers in the <a href="Advanced%20preferences.md#image-storage">Advanced preferences</a>.</p>
<h3 id="add-existing-image">Add existing image</h3>
