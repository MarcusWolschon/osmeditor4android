<h1>Node selected</h1><p>Node selection is described in the <a href="../en/Introduction.html">Introduction</a>. Selected nodes can be moved by dragging in the touch area, you can enable a large drag area in the preferences. You can edit tags for selected nodes.</p><h2>Actions</h2><p>Note: some of these actions will only be visible if they can actually be executed on the selected node. For example you can only merge a node with a way or node if the selected node is in their tolerance zone.</p><h3><img src="../images/undolist_undo.png" alt="Undo" /> Undo</h3><p>Tapping the icon once will undo the last operation. A long press will display a list of the operations since the last save, if you have undone anything a corresponding "redo" action will be displayed.
