<h1>Edit relation members</h1>
<p>This action mode allows interactively creating and editing a relations members by selecting them from the map. Elements that can be added will be highlighted and are clickable.</p>
<p>Points to note</p>
<ul>
<li>you can click on an element that is already a member, you will then be asked if you want to add ot remove it from the relation.</li>
<li>if you click on a member that has multiple possible roles, you will be shown a modal that allows you to choose the role for the element.</li>
<li>if you long click on an element it will be removed directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>If an existing member element is selected that doesn't match a the member expressions defined in the relevant preset you will see a warning. The reason for this is that once you exit the action mode you will no longer be able to add it back directly.</p>
