<h1 id="vespucci-101-highlights">Vespucci 10.1 Highlights</h1>
<p>2018-02-22</p>
<h2 id="under-the-hood">Under the hood</h2>
<p>This release is mainly a clean up release with no major new functionality, but inclusion of projects that were started a while back and some general improvements. There have been some modest performance improvements in both data rendering and with respect to tile retrieval and rendering.</p>
<h2 id="gpx-waypoints">GPX Waypoints</h2>
<p>An imported GPX track can now include GPX way points. These can be selected and converted in to OSM Nodes either via manual selection of a preset, or via an automatic search of the term in the GPX &quot;type&quot; fields in the presets.</p>
<h2 id="imagery-database-custom-imagery-oam-and-mbtiles">Imagery database, custom imagery, OAM and MBTiles</h2>
<p>As you may know we use the <a href="https://github.com/osmlab/editor-layer-index">Editor Layer Index</a> for our background and overlay imagery configuration. Previously we re-read and re-parsed the configuration file on every start of vespucci, we now store the configuration in a database on initial start up and after upgrades. This improves start up time considerably. We've further added a method to download updated configuration directly from the Editor Layer Index site (not available on older Android devices).</p>
<p>Storing this information in a database was a prerequisite to creating a simple UI to allow custom imagery to be added (there is still a facility to include imagery configuration via a file). While we were at it, we've added support for layers in MBTile format for enhanced offline editing.</p>
<p>More information on the topic can be found on <a href="http://vespucci.io/tutorials/custom_imagery/">vespucci.io</a>.</p>
<h3 id="wms-server-support">WMS server support</h3>
<p>10.1 adds limited support for WMS servers that support &quot;web-mercator&quot; projection (EPSG:3857 or EPSG:900913). The requested tiles are 512px x 512px in size to reduce the load on the target servers a bit, still this should likely be used with restraint.</p>
<h3 id="oam-support">OAM Support</h3>
<p>Layers provided via OAM can be added to the imagery configuration via a query to the OAM catalog (this currently doesn't work for devices running older Android versions as OAM doesn't support TLS 1.0).</p>
<h3 id="mbtiles">MBTiles</h3>
<p>MBTile files containing jpeg or png imagery can now be used as custom imagery sources on device.</p>
<h3 id="imagery-offsets">Imagery offsets</h3>
<p>The way how we handle local offsets (contrary to such stored in the <a href="http://offsets.textual.ru/">imagery offset database</a>) has changed. While these were always a bit persistent, it wasn't really clear when and how they would be re-applied or vanish. We now store per adjusted layer one set of offsets permanently, if the app is started with a view near (100m) the location of such an adjustment it will be automatically applied and a warning displayed, the same on background layer changes. This results in non-surprising behaviour: app restarts and pausing in the same location will not suddenly change imagery alignment, but doing so further away from the location will show the layer as is.</p>
<p>This is not intended to be a replacement for storing offsets in and retrieving them from the imagery offset database that allows a far finer degree of control.</p>
<h2 id="geo-location-sensitive-validation">Geo-location sensitive validation</h2>
<p>We've done some initial work on providing support for location sensitive validation, currently this is limited to missing &quot;mph&quot; units in speed tags in countries that use such units.</p>
<h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>
<ul>
<li>In many situations when an empty relation can be created a dialog is shown asking how to proceed.</li>
<li>In high density areas node touch halos will be reduced as you zoom out.</li>
<li>On tablets running Android 7 or higher, sub-menus are not visible due to an Android/support library bug. As a workaround we are providing a menu layout for such devices that doesn't use sub-menus, the layout however is not reflected in the documentation.</li>
