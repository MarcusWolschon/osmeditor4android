<h1>Vespucci 10.1 BETA Highlights</h1><h2>Under the hood</h2><p>This release is mainly a clean up release with no major new functionality, but inclusion of projects that were started a while back and some general improvements. There have been some modest performance improvements in both data rendering and with respect to tile retrieval and rendering.</p><h2>GPX Waypoints</h2><p>An imported GPX track can now include GPX way points. These can be selected and converted in to OSM Nodes either via manual selection of a preset, or via an automatic search of the term in the GPX "type" fields in the presets.</p><h2>Imagery database, custom imagery and MBTiles</h2><p>As you may know we use the <a href="https://github.com/osmlab/editor-layer-index">Editor Layer Index</a> for our background and overlay imagery configuration. Previously we re-read and re-parsed the configuration file on every start of vespucci, we now on initial start up and after upgrades store the configuration in a database. This improves start up time considerably. We've further added a method to download updated configuration directly from the Editor Layer Index site.</p><p>Storing this information in a database was a prerequisite to creating a simple UI to allow custom imagery to be added (there is still a facility to include imagery configuration via a file). While we were at it, we've added support for layers in MBTile format for enhanced offline editing.</p><h3>WMS server support</h3><p>10.1 adds limited support for WMS servers that support "web-mercator" projection (EPSG:3857 or EPSG:900913). The requested tiles are 512px x 512px in size to reduce the load on the target servers a bit, still this should likely be used with restraint.</p><h3>Imagery offsets</h3><p>The way how we handle local offsets (contrary to such stored in the <a href="http://offsets.textual.ru/">imagery offset database</a>) has changed. While these were always a bit persistent, it wasn't really clear when and how they would be re-applied or vanish. We now store per adjusted layer one set of offsets permanently, if the app is started with a view near (100m) the location of such an adjustment it will be automatically applied and a warning displayed, the same on background layer changes. This results in non-surprising behaviour: app restarts and pausing in the same location will not suddenly change imagery alignment, but doing so further away from the location will show the layer as is.</p><p>This is not intended to be a replacement for storing offsets in and retrieving them from the imagery offset database that allows a far finer degree of control.</p><h2>Geo-location sensitive validation</h2><p>We've done some initial work on providing support for location sensitive validation, currently this is limited to missing "mph" units in speed tags in countries that use such units.</p><h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In many situations when an empty relation can be created a dialog is shown asking how to proceed.</li>
  <li>In high density areas node touch halos will be reduced as you zoom out.</li>
