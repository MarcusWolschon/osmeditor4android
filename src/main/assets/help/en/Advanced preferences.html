<h1>Advanced preferences</h1>
<p>The Advanced preferences page is split in to seven topical sections that can be access by clicking on the main entries. Depending on the Android version running on your device some settings may be not available for technical reasons.</p>
<h2>User Interface Settings</h2>
<h3>Show node icons</h3>
<p>Show icons on nodes if they can be matched with a preset. Default: <em>on</em>.</p>
<h3>Show POI icons on buildings</h3>
<p>Show icons on buildings if the tags on the building can be matched with a preset. Default: <em>on</em>.</p>
<h3>Display tag form</h3>
<p>Enable the form based tag editor. Default: <em>on</em>.</p>
<h3>Display labels from presets</h3>
<p>Display labels from presets in the tag form editor. Default: <em>on</em>.</p>
<h3>Show camera action</h3>
<p>Show a camera button on the main display (if a camera app is present). Default: <em>on</em>.</p>
<h3>Camera app</h3>
<p>Select the camera app to use. If your, installed, camera app is not listed, please report this and we will add it to the list. Unluckily google does not allow to automatically determine installed camera apps outside of pre-installed ones. Default: <em>System default</em>.</p>
<h3>Use the MediaStore</h3>
<p>Additionally use Androids MediaStore for accessing photos. This will add all photographs in JPEG format found via the MediaStore that contain coordinates in their EXIF data to the phto layer. Default: <em>off</em>.</p>
<h3>Follow location button layout</h3>
<p>Change the side of the display the &quot;Follow location&quot; button is positioned on or remove it completely. Default: <em>lefthand side</em>.</p>
<h3>Always dim non-downloaded areas</h3>
<p>If on the non-downloaded areas will be dimmed when the screen is locked. Default: <em>off</em>.</p>
<h3>Fullscreen mode</h3>
<p>On devices without hardware buttons Vespucci can run in full screen mode, that means that &quot;virtual&quot; navigation buttons will be automatically hidden while the map is displayed, providing more space on the screen for the map. Depending on your device this may work well or not.</p>
<p>In <em>Auto</em> mode we try to determine automatically if using full screen mode is sensible or not, setting it to <em>Force</em> or <em>Never</em> skips the automatic check and full screen mode will always be used or always not be used respectively. <em>No statusbar</em> will additionally try to remove Androids status bar besides forcing full screen mode.</p>
<p>On devices running Android 11 or higher the <em>Auto</em> mode will never turn full screen mode on as Androids gesture navigation provides a viable alternative to it.</p>
<p>Default on Android 4.4 - 10:0: <em>Auto</em>, 4.0 - 4.3 and 11.0 and later: <em>Never</em>.</p>
<p>You need to restart the app for changes to this setting to take effect.</p>
<h3>Map screen orientation</h3>

<h3>Use back key for Undo</h3>
<p>Use the back key for undo. Default: <em>off</em>.</p>
<h3>Theme</h3>
<p>Select the theme to use. <em>Follow system</em> will follow the setting in the system preferences as far as possible, <em>Light</em> and <em>Dark</em> will fix the setting on the respective theme. <em>Follow system</em> is only available on Android 10 and later. Default: <em>Follow system</em>. You need to restart the app for changes to this setting to take effect.</p>
<h3>Enable split action bar</h3>
<p>Show the menu buttons at the bottom of the screen. Default: <em>on</em>. You need to restart the app for changes to this setting to take effect.</p>
<h3>App language</h3>
<p>Select a language for the user interface that is different from the device default, setting the value to <em>Device language</em> will revert to using your preference for the whole device. On devices running Android 13 and later the app language can be changed in the system settings too. Preset translations can be disabled in the preset configurations.</p>
