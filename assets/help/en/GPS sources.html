All three sources are unfiltered and the minimum GPS change values are ignored.</p><p>In all three cases the only sentences that are supported are $..GGA and $..GNS. Vespucci will prioritize information from NMEA "talkers" as follows: GN (multiple talkers) &gt; GP (GPS) &gt; GL (GLONASS).</p><h3 id="setup">Setup</h3><p>In the "Advanced preferences" you can select the "GPS source"</p><ul><li><strong>Internal</strong> - default</li><li><strong>Internal NMEA</strong></li><li><strong>NMEA from TCP client</strong> - use a client to retrieve NMEA data from an external server</li><li><strong>NMEA from TCP server</strong> - allow an external client to submit NMEA data</li></ul><p>For the later two options you need to set the "NMEA network source", the string has the format <strong>host:port</strong>. The host is ignored for the server option and the process binds to the external address of the device (not localhost) at the configured port.</p></body></html>
