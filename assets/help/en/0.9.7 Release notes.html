		<ul>
			<li>Address tags used for address prediction can be configured.</li>
			<li>Alert/Notification generation from auto-download background process</li>
			<li>Reworked implementation of the Notes subsystem.
				    * Support for Osmose generated "Bugs"
				    * Offline support: "Bugs" can be downloaded at home and added/edited during survey and either uploaded immediately individually or in bulk post-survey. Downloaded data will be stored over the app life cycle and will remain available even if the app is terminated.
				    * Filtering of Osmose issue levels
				    * Separate auto-download parameters</li>
			<li>Support for translated presets. </li>
			<li>Search in presets.</li>
			<li>Improved keyboard support</li>
			<li>Grid/scale overlay</li>
			<li>Experimental voice support (work in progress)
				    * in "New" mode (long press): a name (example "McDonalds") or a preset name, either in English (or in German), (example: "Butcher" or "Fleischer" or "Fleischer Schmidt") or a number ("twentytwo") will create a node of the corresponding kind or an address 
				on the main screen 
				    * in lock mode touching the screen will work with "map" or in German "hier" followed by one of the above, the node will be created at the current GPS position (which is less useful than you think)
				    * note: the facility uses googles voice recognition framework which requires a working network connection</li>
