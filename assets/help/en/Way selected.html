For example you can only split a way that has more than two way nodes.</p><h3 id="images-undolist_undo-png-undo"><img alt="" border="0" src="../images/undolist_undo.png"/> Undo</h3><p>Tapping the icon once will undo the last operation. A long press will display a list of the operations since the last save, if you have undone anything a corresponding "redo" action will be displayed. If the undo results in the current selected object being removed you will be returned to the main screen. <em>Some operations consist of multiple simpler actions that will be listed as individual items.</em></p><h3 id="images-tag_menu_tags-png-properties"><img alt="" border="0" src="../images/tag_menu_tags.png"/> Properties</h3><p>Starts the property editor on the current selection.</p><h3 id="images-address-png-add-address-tags"><img alt="" border="0" src="../images/address.png"/> Add address tags</h3><p>Adds address tags with prediction. Only visible if way is tagged as building.</p><h3 id="images-tag_menu_reverse-png-reverse-way"><img alt="" border="0" src="../images/tag_menu_reverse.png"/> Reverse way</h3><p>Reverse the direction of the way. If the way has direction dependent tags it will automatically change them to still have the same effect as before the direction change. oneway tags are not automatically reversed here the assumption is that the intent was to change the effect of the tag, the tag editor will be started automatically and you can change the tag manually if necessary. Direction dependent tags currently handled are:</p><ul><li>direction</li><li>incline</li><li>turn:lanes and turn</li><li>*:left, *:right, *:left:*, *:right:*, left and right</li><li>*:backward, *:forward, *:backward:*, *:forward:*, backward and forward</li></ul><h3 id="images-tag_menu_split-png-split"><img alt="" border="0" src="../images/tag_menu_split.png"/> Split</h3><p>Split the selected way, the nodes at the available locations for splitting will have a visible touch area. The "Split" action is only available if the way has more than two nodes. If the way is closed you will need to select two nodes.</p><h3 id="images-tag_menu_merge-png-merge"><img alt="" border="0" src="../images/tag_menu_merge.png"/> Merge</h3><p>Join the selected way with one that it shares a node with resulting in a single way. This option will only be available if the ways have compatible tags and relation memberships.</p><h3 id="images-tag_menu_append-png-append"><img alt="" border="0" src="../images/tag_menu_append.png"/> Append</h3><p>Append to the current selected way. Touch areas will be visible around nodes that can be used to extend the way, select "Done" or the same node twice to stop. The "Append" action is only available if the way in question is not closed.</p><h3 id="images-menu_ortho-png-orthogonalize"><img alt="" border="0" src="../images/menu_ortho.png"/> Orthogonalize</h3><p>Change angles that are near 90� or 180� to 90� resp. 180�.</p><h3 id="images-ic_menu_rotate-png-rotate"><img alt="" border="0" src="../images/ic_menu_rotate.png"/> Rotate</h3><p>Rotate the way around its centroid. The centroid position is marked with a cross.</p><h3 id="split-in-to-polygons">Split in to polygons</h3><p>Available for closed ways with at least for nodes. Will split the way in to two polygons, sharing the common nodes.</p><h3 id="images-ic_menu_copy_holo_light-png-copy"><img alt="" border="0" src="../images/ic_menu_copy_holo_light.png"/> Copy</h3><p>Copy the way to the internal copy and paste buffer.</p><h3 id="images-ic_menu_cut_holo_light-png-cut"><img alt="" border="0" src="../images/ic_menu_cut_holo_light.png"/> Cut</h3><p>Move the way to the internal copy and paste buffer removing it fron the data.</p><h3 id="images-tag_menu_delete-png-delete"><img alt="" border="0" src="../images/tag_menu_delete.png"/> Delete</h3><p>Remove the object from the data.</p><h3 id="images-extend_selection-png-extend-selection"><img alt="" border="0" src="../images/extend_selection.png"/> Extend selection</h3><p>Start Multi-Select mode with the current selected element.</p><h3 id="images-relation-png-create-relation"><img alt="" border="0" src="../images/relation.png"/> Create relation</h3><p>Create a relation and add this object as the first element. Further objects can be added until "Done" is selected, then the tag editor will be started on the new relation. </p><h3 id="images-tag_menu_mapfeatures-png-info"><img alt="" border="0" src="../images/tag_menu_mapfeatures.png"/> Info</h3><p>Show a screen with some detailed information on the selected object.</p><h3 id="images-menu_help-png-help"><img alt="" border="0" src="../images/menu_help.png"/> Help</h3><p>Start the Vespucci Help browser</p></body></html>
