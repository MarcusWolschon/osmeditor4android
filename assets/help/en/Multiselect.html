<h1>Multiselect</h1>
<p>Selected elements can be moved by dragging in the touch area. Individual objects can be selected / de-selected by (single) tapping them. A double tap in an entry area will end the mode.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<h3><img alt="" src="../images/undolist_undo.png" /> Undo</h3>
<p>Tapping the icon once will undo the last operation. A long press will display a list of the operations since the last save, if you have undone anything a corresponding "redo" action will be displayed. If the undo results in the current selected object being removed you will be returned to the main screen. <em>Some operations consist of multiple simpler actions that will be listed as individual items.</em></p>

<h3><img alt="" src="../images/tag_menu_delete.png" /> Delete</h3>

<h3><img alt="" src="../images/tag_menu_merge.png" /> Merge ways</h3>
<p>Merge multiple selected ways resulting in a single way. Ways will be reversed if necessary. This option will only be available if only ways with common start/end nodes are selected. In pre-merge tag conflicts are detected you will be asked to fix them first and the property editor will be started on the selection, the same post-merge. </p>
<h3><img alt="" src="../images/relation.png" /> Create relation</h3>
