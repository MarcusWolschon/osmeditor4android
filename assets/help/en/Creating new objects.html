<h1>New</h1><p>After a long press on the map on the main screen you will enter the "New" mode (also see <a href="../en/Introduction.html">Introduction</a>). This is the main way to add new nodes, ways and OSM Notes in Vespucci. At the place were you touched the screen you will see a cross marker.</p><p>You can now do one of three things:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>touch in the same place again</strong> - this will add a node at the location and start the tag editor. If the location is within the tolerance zone of a way it will be added as a new node to that way.</li>
  <li><strong>touch some other place on the screen</strong> - this will create a way from the initial location to this location, the way acan be further extended by adding further node. Touching the last location completes the way and starts the tag editor.</li>
  <li><strong>select a menu item</strong> see below</li>
</ul><p>Both the last node and the complete way can be moved without leaving "New" mode.</p><h2>Further actions</h2><h3>![](../images/address.png) Add address tags</h3><p>Adds a node at the current location and adds address tags with prediction. If the node is part of a building way it will further add "entrance=yes" if not present.</p><h3>![](../images/tag_menu_preset.png) Add preset</h3><p>Create the current new object, launch the <a href="PropertyEditor">property editor</a> and immediately display the preset tab. In multi-pane mode this will simply start the property editor.</p><h3>![](../images/tag_menu_bug.png) Add a OpenStreetMap Note</h3><p>Create an OpenStreetMap Note at the point.</p><h3>![](../images/tag_menu_append.png) Create path</h3><p>Start the path/way creation mode, just as if you had touch the screen again.</p><h3>![](../images/ic_menu_paste_holo_light.png) Paste</h3><p>Copy the object in internal copy and paste buffer to the current position. If the object was originally cut this has the same effect as if you moved the object to the new position and the buffer will be empty after the operation. </p><h3>![](../images/menu_gps.png) New node at GPS pos.</h3><p>This will create a node at the current GPS position and add elevation tags to it. Note it doesn't matter where on the screen you originally touched, the node will be created at the GPS location.</p><h3>![](../images/menu_help.png) Help</h3><p>Start the Vespucci Help browser</p>
