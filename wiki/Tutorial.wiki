= Vespucci Quick Start Guide =
(Updated for version 0.9)

== Installation ==

Just search for "vespucci" on the android market place and install it.

== Initial Set-Up ==

Vespucci 0.9 supports OAuth authorization besides the classical username and password method. OAuth is preferable, particularly for mobile applications since it avoids sending passwords in the clear.

New Vespucci installs will have OAuth enabled by default. On your first attempt to upload a page from the OSM website will be loaded. After you have logged on (over an encrypted connection) you will be asked to authorize Vespucci to edit using your account. Once you have done that you can return to Vespucci (using the back button) and retry the upload which now should succeed.

== Editing Using Vespucci ==

=== Downloading OSM Data ===

Press the Menu button, select 'More' then 'Transfer'.  

Select "Download other location".  Select "Current Location" to download data near your current position.  Use the slider to specify how much data to download, in terms of the radius from the selected location.   Select the "Load!" button to download the data (note the the Load! button is sometimes not visible on smaller screens so you have to scroll to the bottom to find it).

Then Vespucci should center the map on your current location.

Zoom in using gestures, the zoom buttons or the volume control buttons on the telephone. 

=== Editing ===

To avoid accidental edits Vespucci 0.9 will start up in "locked" mode, a mode that only allows zooming and moving the map. Pressing the red lock icon will "unlock" Vespucci and allow editing. Note: the old drop down menu can be enabled from the Preferences.
 
The default editing mode is now what used to be called [EasyEdit] mode. With the default settings nodes and ways that are selectable will have an orange area around them indicating roughly where you have to touch to select an object. If you try to select an object and Vespucci determines that the selection could mean multiple object it will present a selection menu. Selected objects are highlighted in yellow.

Depending on screen size and age of your device editing actions may either be accessible directly via icons in the top bar, via a drop down menu on the right of the top bar, or via the menu key.
 

=== Saving Your Changes ===

Press the Menu button, select 'More' then 'Transfer' followed by "Upload data to OSM server".
Note that if you have only changed tags, but not created or moved nodes, Vespuci 0.6.2 says that you have not changed anything, so will not upload the data.  Move a note a little bit to persuade it.

I do not think vespucci warns you if you have not saved your changes?
