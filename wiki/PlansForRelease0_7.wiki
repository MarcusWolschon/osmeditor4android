= User Interface Changes =

== Menus == 
Simplify menu structure to a more logical hierarchy and minimise the number of key presses for popular functions (need to think what this means!).

== Key Presses ==
|| Key                      || Function       || Note   ||
|| Vol+                     || Zoom in        || Unchanged from 0.6.1 ||
|| Vol-                     || Zoom out       || Unchanged from 0.6.1  ||
|| Single Press on Display  || Select Element  || If you click on something  ||
|| Double Press on Display  || Edit Tags      || If you click on something   ||
|| Long Press on Display    || Add Node, and open tag editor  || What do we do if you click on something - just edit it?  ||
|| Menu Button  || Display Menu!  ||   ||
|| Back Button  || Prompt to ask if you really want to exit.  Warn if unsaved data.  ||   ||
|| Home Button || Minimise || I don't think we have a choice over this? I would like to add a prompt, but don't know how. ||

== Display ==
Add pre-rendered map tiles as a background (probaby plagiarise it off [http://opensatnav.org OpenSatNav]).

= Other Changes =
== GPS Track Log ==
Record GPS track logs as GPX files so that they are not lost if the program exits.  Provide a specific menu to manage GPX traces - add to display, upload to OSM, delete etc.

== Background Running ==
Make the program run in the background, with a menu in the task bar, if GPX recording is in progress, rather than exiting - a bit like OpenSatNav does.
