= Frequently Asked Questions =

== 1. Introduction ==

==== What is Vespucci? ====
Vespucci is the first OpenStreetMap editor for Android.
That means: It is a light-weight, easy-to-use mapping tool on mobile Android devices.


====What is Vespucci NOT?====
 * Vespucci is not a mobile map-viewer. It does not display pre-rendered tiles (e.g. Mapnik, Osmarender ...)
 * Vespucci is not a mobile navigation solution. It does not feature any routing algorithm.
 * Vespucci is not a professional editor like JOSM or Merkaator. It strives for maximum usability on mobile devices which are limited in many regards. It is not intended to support the full feature set of some other OSM editors running on fully blown PCs.


====I am already familiar with OSM editor xyz. Why should I use Vespucci? ====
If you are mapping for OSM and already have an Android device (or planning for this) then Vespucci could help in your mapping work. Data is aquired "on site" and uploaded to the OSM server. By entering data in your mobile device "on the road" you can save time because you do not have to upload GPS tracks to your home PC and work your way again through these.
Additionally, obscure OSM data can be verified easily and quickly "on site", data which is already available in OSM is not aquired again.


====What do I need to get started with Vespucci? ====
You need:
 * An Android device (or the emulator)
 * The Vespucci APK file (also available over the Android Market)
 * Some familiarity with [http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features OSM Map features]
 * An [http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new OSM account] 


====What is the status of Vespucci development? ==== 
The current Vespucci version is 0.6.1. It's still in beta-stage.


====Is Vespucci available for other mobile platforms?==== 
No. Android uses a specialized VM implementation designed for mobile device use, which is technically not a standard Java Virtual Machine. Development effort for other mobile platforms is unknown and the development team is not planning for this. (Of yourse you are welcome to do so ...)


====How can I obtain Vespucci? ==== 
The Vespucci APK can be downloaded from the [http://code.google.com/p/osmeditor4android Vespucci project page]
With respect to the development status it is not yet available through the Android market.


====How can I install Vespucci on my Android device? ==== 
*Answer outstanding (can someone provide a short description who owns an Android device?)*


====How can I install Vespucci on the Android emulator? ==== 
Installation of the Vespucci APK is like any other APK. 
There are plenty descriptions available (e.g. [http://openhandsetmagazine.com/2008/01/tips-how-to-install-apk-files-on-android-emulator/ 1 ], [http://www.androidfreeware.org/tutorials/how-to-install-apk-files-on-android-device-emulator 2 ], [http://www.freeware4android.com/2008/07/30/tutorial-installing-apk-files-on-android-device-emulator.html  3 ], [http://clipmarks.com/clipmark/FB4A2E39-6DA1-4EBC-BBF0-5131E1AC6128/ 4 ])


== 2. Features ==

====What can I do with the editor?====

Currently, you can 
 * Add and move nodes and ways
 * Edit the tags of nodes and ways
 * Append nodes to existing ways
 * Delete existing nodes
 * Move existing nodes 
 * Automatically join nodes to ways
 * Download area around current location from OSM server
 * Download user-specified areas from OSM server
 * Create and save GPS tracks
 * All edit functions in portrait and landscape mode


====My Android device does not have a physical keyboard. Does Vespucci support a soft keyboard? ==== 
 
Yes. Soft keyboard is available in portrait mode. (see issue 25)

*unclear to me: on-screen keyboard support. see issue id 25 with status accepted.
 when editing tags in portrait mode, there is a soft keyboard, when editing tags in landscape mode, there is NO soft keyboard (version 0.6.1 in Android emulator)
 Is this work finished, or still ongoing? 


====Auto Download====

*unclear to me: does Vespucci have an auto-follow/auto-download function? 
   I have not had the time to simulate GPS positions on my Android emulator, so I could not try out yet. See issue id 14 ???)


====Does Vespucci support Open Street Bugs?====
 
No. (Not yet?)


====What are the limits of Vespucci?====

Vespucci is limited in the following sense:
 * Relations are not supported (but elements which are part of a relation are not harmed by being edited in Vespucci of course)
 * Undo function is planned (see issue id 5)
 * Tool functions like 
  * reverse way, combine way, simplify way, unglue ways are currently not implemented. 
  * split ways is planned (see issue id 7)
 * Cannot insert nodes into the midde of ways. Appending to ways at their ends is well-supported.
 * No download of pre-rendered tiles as slippy map background (e.g. Mapnik, Osmarender ...)
 * No WSM download for the background (e.g. Yahoo aerials).
 * No validator yet (see issue id 31)
 * [http://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/TaggingPresets Tagging-presets ] are not (yet?) supported (see issue 23)

 Remember, Android is intended to be lightweight and easy-to-use.


====Which languages are supported?====

English, French and Russian.


== 3. Usage ==

====How can I download OSM data?==== 

On startup, Vespucci requests which area to download. You can choose from the following options:
 * Current location
 * Last known location 
 * Coordinates. If you need access to specific geographic coordinates you can specify latitude/longitude.
 * Map (coming soon)
For all download options, the additional parameter "Radius" is used. It specifies how large the downloaded area is. (In detail: Radius is half the side length of the bounding box that is used when  downloading.)   


====How can I upload new/changed data to the OSM server?====

Choose "Menu | More | Transfer | Upload data to  OSM server".
(With other words: Data is not automatically uploaded!)


====Which user account is used when uploading data to the OSM server?====

Vespucci uses the username and password that you provide through the following dialogs:
 "Menu | More | Preferences | OSM Username"
 "Menu | More | Preferences | OSM Password"
Vespucci does not come with any "default user / password".


====How can I zoom into an area?====

Use the volume buttons of your Android device.
