= Frequently Asked Questions =

== 1. Introduction ==

==== What is Vespucci? ====
Vespucci is the first OpenStreetMap editor for Android.
That means: It is a light-weight, easy-to-use mapping tool on mobile Android devices.


====What is Vespucci NOT?====
 * Vespucci is not a mobile map-viewer. It does not display pre-rendered tiles (e.g. Mapnik, Osmarender ...)
 * Vespucci is not a mobile navigation solution. It does not feature any routing algorithm.
 * Vespucci is not a professional editor like JOSM or Merkaator. It strives for maximum usability on mobile devices which are limited in many regards. It is not intended to support the full feature set of some other OSM editors running on fully blown PCs.


====I am already familiar with OSM editor xyz. Why should I use Vespucci? ====
If you are mapping for OSM and already have an Android device (or planning for this) then Vespucci could help in your mapping work. Data is aquired "on site" and uploaded to the OSM server. By entering data in your mobile device "on the road" you can save time because you do not have to upload GPS tracks to your home PC and work your way again through these.
Additionally, obscure OSM data can be verified easily and quickly "on site", data which is already available in OSM is not aquired again.


====What do I need to get started with Vespucci? ====
You need:
 * An Android device (or the emulator)
 * The Vespucci APK file (also available over the Android Market)
 * Some familiarity with [http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features OSM Map features]
 * An [http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new OSM account] 


====What is the status of Vespucci development? ==== 
The current Vespucci version is 0.6.1. It's still in beta-stage.


====Is Vespucci available for other mobile platforms?==== 
No. Android uses a specialized VM implementation designed for mobile device use, which is technically not a standard Java Virtual Machine. Development effort for other mobile platforms is unknown and the development team is not planning for this. (Of yourse you are welcome to do so ...)


====How can I obtain Vespucci? ==== 
 * You can download it from the Android Market (Search for "Vespucci")
 * The Vespucci APK can be downloaded from the [http://code.google.com/p/osmeditor4android Vespucci project page]


====How can I install Vespucci on my Android device? ==== 
Just download and install like any other app =)


====How can I install Vespucci on the Android emulator? ==== 
Installation of the Vespucci APK is like any other APK. 
There are plenty descriptions available (e.g. [http://openhandsetmagazine.com/2008/01/tips-how-to-install-apk-files-on-android-emulator/ 1 ], [http://www.androidfreeware.org/tutorials/how-to-install-apk-files-on-android-device-emulator 2 ], [http://www.freeware4android.com/2008/07/30/tutorial-installing-apk-files-on-android-device-emulator.html  3 ], [http://clipmarks.com/clipmark/FB4A2E39-6DA1-4EBC-BBF0-5131E1AC6128/ 4 ])

== 3. Usage ==

====How can I download OSM data?==== 

On startup, Vespucci requests which area to download. You can choose from the following options:
 * Current location
 * Last known location 
 * Coordinates. If you need access to specific geographic coordinates you can specify latitude/longitude.
 * Map (coming soon)
For all download options, the additional parameter "Radius" is used. It specifies how large the downloaded area is. (In detail: Radius is half the side length of the bounding box that is used when  downloading.)   


====How can I upload new/changed data to the OSM server?====

Choose "Menu | More | Transfer | Upload data to  OSM server".
(With other words: Data is not automatically uploaded!)


====Which user account is used when uploading data to the OSM server?====

Vespucci uses the username and password that you provide through the following dialogs:
 "Menu | More | Preferences | OSM Username"
 "Menu | More | Preferences | OSM Password"
Vespucci does not come with any "default user / password".


====How can I zoom into an area?====

Use the volume buttons of your Android device.
