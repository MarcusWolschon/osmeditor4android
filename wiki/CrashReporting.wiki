#summary How Vespucci Crash Reports work.

= Description =

Vespucci uses the ACRA library to handle crash reports. Crash reports are sent to a publically readable Google Docs spreadsheet, which can be found at:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiX5DlgmFc_AdEtPR2twakdQbS1TbTVQNjdKeHBiLXc

Crash reports are handled manually by Vespucci developers. As reported crashes are deemed fixed, they will be deleted from the spreadsheet.
