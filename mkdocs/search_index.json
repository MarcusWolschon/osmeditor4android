            "text": "Vespucci Introduction\n\n\nVespucci is a full featured OpenStreetMap editor that supports most operations that desktop editors provide. It has been tested successfully on googles Android 2.3 to 6.0 and various AOSP based variants. A word of caution: while mobile devices capabilities have caught up with their desktop rivals, particularly older devices have very limited memory available and tend to be rather slow. You should take this in to account when using Vespucci and keep, for example, the size of the areas you are editing to a reasonable size. \n\n\nFirst time use\n\n\nOn startup Vespucci shows you the \"Download other location\"/\"Load Area\" dialog. If you have coordinates displayed and want to download immediately, you can select the appropriate option and set the radius around the location that you want to download. Do not select a large area on slow devices. \n\n\nAlternatively you can dismiss the dialog by pressing the \"Go to map\" button and pan and zoom to a location you want to edit and download the data then (see below: \"Editing with Vespucci\").\n\n\nEditing with Vespucci\n\n\nDepending on screen size and age of your device editing actions may either be accessible directly via icons in the top bar, via a drop down menu on the right of the top bar, from the bottom bar (if present) or via the menu key.\n\n\nDownloading OSM Data\n\n\nSelect either the transfer icon \n  or the \"Transfer\" menu item. This will display seven options:\n\n\n\n\nDownload current view\n - download the area visible on the screen and replace any existing data \n(requires network connectivity)\n\n\nAdd current view to download\n - download the area visible on the screen and merge it with existing data \n(requires network connectivity)\n\n\nDownload other location\n - shows a form that allows you to enter coordinates, search for a location or use the current position, and then download an area around that location \n(requires network connectivity)\n\n\nUpload data to OSM server\n - upload edits to OpenStreetMap \n(requires authentication)\n \n(requires network connectivity)\n\n\nAuto download\n - download an area around the current location automatically \n(requires network connectivity)\n \n(requires GPS)\n\n\nFile...\n - saving and loading OSM data to/from on device files.\n\n\nNote/Bugs...\n - download (automatically and manually) OSM Notes and \"Bugs\" from QA tools (currently OSMOSE) \n(requires network connectivity)\n\n\n\n\nThe easiest way to download data to the device is to zoom and pan to the location you want to edit and then to select \"Download current view\". You can zoom by using gestures, the zoom buttons or the volume control buttons on the telephone.  Vespucci should then download data for the current view. No authentication is required for downloading data to your device.\n\n\nEditing\n\n\nLock, unlock, \"tag editing only\"\n\n\nTo avoid accidental edits Vespucci starts in \"locked\" mode, a mode that only allows zooming and moving the map. Tap the \n icon to unlock the screen. A long press on the lock icon will enable \"Tag editing only\" mode which will not allow you to create new objects or edit the geometry of objects, this mode is indicated with a slightly different white lock icon.\n\n\nSinge tap, double tap, and long press\n\n\nBy default, selectable nodes and ways have an orange area around them indicating roughly where you have to touch to select an object. You have three options:\n\n\n\n\nSingle tap: Selects object. \n\n\nAn isolated node/way is highlighted immediately. \n\n\nHowever, if you try to select an object and Vespucci determines that the selection could mean multiple objects it will present a selection menu, enabling you to choose the object you wish to select. \n\n\nSelected objects are highlighted in yellow. \n\n\nFor further information see \nNode selected\n and \nWay selected\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble tap: Start \nMultiselect mode\n\n\nLong press: Creates a \"crosshair\", enabling you to add nodes, see below and \nCreating new objects\n\n\n\n\nIt is a good strategy to zoom in if you attempt to edit a high density area.\n\n\nVespucci has a good \"undo/redo\" system so don't be afraid of experimenting on your device, however please do not upload and save pure test data.\n\n\nSelecting / De-selecting (single tap and \"selection menu\")\n\n\nTouch an object to select and highlight it. Touching the screen in an empty region will de-select. If you have selected an object and you need to select something else, simply touch the object in question, there is no need to de-select first. A double tap on an object will start \nMultiselect mode\n.\n\n\nNote that if you try to select an object and Vespucci determines that the selection could mean multiple objects (such as a node on a way or other overlapping objects) it will present a selection menu: Tap the object you wish to select and the object is selected. \n\n\nSelected objects are indicated through a thin yellow border. The yellow border may be hard to spot, depending on map background and zoom factor. Once a selection has been made, you will see a notification confirming the selection.\n\n\nYou can also use menu items: For further information see \nNode selected\n and \nWay selected\n.\n\n\nSelected objects: Editing tags\n\n\nA second touch on the selected object opens the tag editor and you can edit the tags associated with the object.\n\n\nNote that for overlapping objects (such as a node on a way) the selection menu comes back up for a second time. Selecting the same object brings up the tag editor; selecting another object simple selects the other object.\n\n\nSelected objects: Moving a Node or Way\n\n\nOnce you have selected an object, it can be moved. Note that objects can be dragged/moved only when they are selected. Simply drag near (i.e. within the tolerance zone of) the selected object to move it. If you select the large drag area in the preferences, you get a large area around the selected node that makes it easier to position the object. \n\n\nAdding a new Node/Point or Way (long press)\n\n\nLong press where you want the node to be or the way to start. You will see a black \"crosshair\" symbol. \n\n If you want to create a new node (not connected to an object), click away from existing objects.\n\n If you want to extend a way, click within the \"tolerance zone\" of the way (or a node on the way). The tolerance zone is indicated by the areas around a node or way.\n\n\nOnce you can see the crosshair symbol, you have these options:\n\n\n\n\nTouch in the same place.\n\n\nIf the crosshair is not near a node, touching the same location again creates a new node. If you are near a way (but not near a node), the new node will be on the way (and connected to the way).\n\n\nIf the crosshair is near a node (i.e. within the tolerance zone of the node), touching the same location just selects the node (and the tag editor opens. No new node is created. The action is the same as the selection above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTouch another place. Touching another location (outside of the tolerance zone of the crosshair) adds a way segment from the original position to the current position. If the crosshair was near a way or node, the new segment will be connected to that node or way.\n\n\n\n\nSimply touch the screen where you want to add further nodes of the way. To finish, touch the final node twice. If the final node is  located on a way or node, the segment will be connected to the way or node automatically. \n\n\nYou can also use a menu item: See \nCreating new objects\n for more information.\n\n\nImproving Way Geometry\n\n\nIf you zoom in far enough you will see a small \"x\" in the middle of way segments that are long enough. Dragging the \"x\" will create a node in the way at that location. Note: to avoid accidentally creating nodes, the touch tolerance for this operation is fairly small.\n\n\nCut, Copy \n Paste\n\n\nYou can copy or cut selected nodes and ways, and then paste once or multiple times to a new location. Cutting will retain the osm id and version. To paste long press the location you want to paste to (you will see a cross hair marking the location). Then select \"Paste\" from the menu.\n\n\nEfficiently Adding Addresses\n\n\nVespucci has an \"add address tags\" function that tries to make surveying addresses more efficient. It can be selected \n\n\n\n\nafter a long press: Vespucci will add a node at the location and make a best guess at the house number and add address tags that you have been lately been using. If the node is on a building outline it will automatically add a \"entrance=yes\" tag to the node. The tag editor will open for the object in question and let you make any necessary further changes.\n\n\nin the node/way selected modes: Vespucci will add address tags as above and start the tag editor.\n\n\nin the tag editor.\n\n\n\n\nHouse number prediction typically requires at least two house numbers on each side of the road to be entered to work, the more numbers present in the data the better.\n\n\nConsider using this with the \"Auto-download\" mode.  \n\n\nAdding Turn Restrictions\n\n\nVespucci has a fast way to add turn restrictions, if necessary it will split ways automatically and, if necessary, ask you to re-select elements. \n\n\n\n\nselect a way with a highway tag (turn restrictions can only be added to highways, if you need to do this for other ways, please use the generic \"create relation\" mode)\n\n\nselect \"Add restriction\" from the menu\n\n\nselect the \"via\" node or way (only possible \"via\" elements will have the touch area shown)\n\n\nselect the \"to\" way (it is possible to double back and set the \"to\" element to the \"from\" element, Vespucci will assume that you are adding an no_u_turn restriction)\n\n\nset the restriction type in the property editor\n\n\n\n\nVespucci in \"locked\" mode\n\n\nWhen the red lock is displayed all non-editing actions are available. Additionally a long press on or near to an object will display the detail information screen if it is an OSM object.\n\n\nSaving Your Changes\n\n\n(requires network connectivity)\n\n\nSelect the same button or menu item you did for the download and now select \"Upload data to OSM server\".\n\n\nVespucci supports OAuth authorization and the classical username and password method. OAuth is preferable since it avoids sending passwords in the clear.\n\n\nNew Vespucci installs will have OAuth enabled by default. On your first attempt to upload modified data, a page from the OSM website loads. After you have logged on (over an encrypted connection) you will be asked to authorize Vespucci to edit using your account. If you want to or need to authorize the OAuth access to your account before editing there is a corresponding item in the \"Tools\" menu.\n\n\nIf you want to save your work and do not have Internet access, you can save to a JOSM compatible .osm file and either upload later with Vespucci or with JOSM. \n\n\nResolving conflicts on uploads\n\n\nVespucci has a simple conflict resolver. However if you suspect that there are major issues with your edits, export your changes to a .osc file (\"Export\" menu item in the \"Transfer\" menu) and fix and upload them with JOSM. See the detailed help on \nconflict resolution\n.  \n\n\nUsing GPS\n\n\nYou can use Vespucci to create a GPX track and display it on your device. Further you can display the current GPS position (set \"Show location\" in the GPS menu) and/or have the screen center around and follow the position (set \"Follow GPS Position\" in the GPS menu). \n\n\nIf you have the later set, moving the screen manually or editing will cause the \"follow GPS\" mode to be disabled and the blue GPS arrow will change from an outline to a filled arrow. To quickly return to the \"follow\" mode, simply touch the arrow or re-check the option from the menu.\n\n\nNotes and Bugs\n\n\nVespucci supports downloading, commenting and closing of OSM Notes (formerly OSM Bugs) and the equivalent functionality for \"Bugs\" produced by the \nOSMOSE quality assurance tool\n. Both have to either be downloaded explicitly or you can use the auto download facility to access the items in your immediate area. Once edited or closed, you can either upload the bug or Note immediately or upload all at once.\n\n\nOn the map the Notes and bugs are represented by a small bug icon \n, green ones are closed/resolved, blue ones have been created or edited by you, and yellow indicates that it is still active and hasn't been changed. \n\n\nThe OSMOSE bug display will provide a link to the affected object in blue, touching the link will select the object, center the screen on it and down load the area beforehand if necessary. \n\n\nFiltering\n\n\nBesides globally enabling the notes and bugs display you can set a coarse grain display filter to reduce clutter. In the \"Advanced preferences\" you can individually select:\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nOsmose error\n\n\nOsmose warning\n\n\nOsmose minor issue\n\n\n\n\nCustomizing Vespucci\n\n\nSettings that you might want to change\n\n\n\n\nBackground layer\n\n\nOverlay layer. Adding an overlay may cause issues with older devices and such with limited memory. Default: none.\n\n\nNotes/Bugs display. Open Notes and bugs will be displayed as a yellow bug icon, closed ones the same in green. Default: on.\n\n\nPhoto layer. Displays georeferenced photographs as red camera icons, if direction information is available the icon will be rotated. Default: off.\n\n\nNode icons. Default: on.\n\n\nKeep screen on. Default: off.\n\n\nLarge node drag area. Moving nodes on a device with touch input is problematic since your fingers will obscure the current position on the display. Turning this on will provide a large area which can be used for off-center dragging (selection and other operations still use the normal touch tolerance area). Default: off.\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced preferences\n\n\n\n\nAlways show context menu. When turned on every selection process will show the context menu, turned off the menu is displayed only when no unambiguous selection can be determined. Default: off (used to be on).\n\n\nEnable light theme. On modern devices this is turned on by default. While you can enable it for older Android versions the style is likely to be inconsistent.\n\n\nShow statistics. Will show some statistics for debugging, not really useful. Default: off (used to be on).  \n\n\n\n\nReporting Problems\n\n\nIf Vespucci crashes, or it detects an inconsistent state, you will be asked to send in the crash dump. Please do so if that happens, but please only once per specific situation. If you want to give further input or open an issue for a feature request or similar, please do so here: \nVespucci issue tracker\n. If you want to discuss something related to Vespucci, you can either start a discussion on the \nVespucci google group\n or on the \nOpenStreetMap Android forum",

The way it works in vespucci now is slightly different from the current implementation in iD and at least some aspects might be worthwhile supporting there too.

Particularly if lots of languages are in use, the preset file itself would explode in size, become essentially illegible and force the application to parse many 100's if not 1000's of attributes for languages it is not interested in.   For Vespucci I've chosen a different approach based on  GNU gettext  format files, the simple  Preset2Pot  utility will generate a .pot file from a preset which you can use with one of the translation services to produce GNU gettext compatible translations of all the strings in the preset (excluding the actual key and value strings).",

            "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\nWhat is Vespucci?\n\n\nVespucci is the first \nOpenStreetMap\n editor for Android.\nThat means: It is a light-weight, easy-to-use mapping tool on mobile Android devices.\n\n\nWhat is Vespucci NOT?\n\n\n\n\nVespucci is not primarily a mobile map-viewer. \n\n\nVespucci is not a mobile navigation solution. It does not feature any routing algorithm.\n\n\nVespucci is not a full replacement for JOSM or other desktop editors, but nearly. It strives for maximum usability on mobile devices which are limited in many regards. \n\n\n\n\nI am already familiar with OSM editor xyz. Why should I use Vespucci?\n\n\nIf you are mapping for OSM and already have an Android device (or planning for this) then Vespucci could help in your mapping work. Data is acquired \"on site\" and uploaded to the OSM server. By entering data in your mobile device \"on the road\" you can save time because you do not have to upload GPS tracks to your home PC and work your way again through these.\nAdditionally, obscure OSM data can be verified easily and quickly \"on site\", data which is already available in OSM is not acquired again.\n\n\nWhat do I need to get started with Vespucci?\n\n\nYou need:\n\n\n\n\nAn Android device (or the emulator) Release 0.9.X has only been tested on Android 2.3 and later.\n\n\nThe Vespucci APK file (available from the Android Market and github)\n\n\nSome familiarity with \nOSM Map features\n\n\nAn \nOSM account\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the status of Vespucci development?\n\n\nThe current Vespucci version is 0.9.7, 0.9.8 is currently in developement.\n\n\nIs Vespucci available for other mobile platforms?\n\n\nNo, with the exception of those that provide an Android compatible environment.\n\n\nHow can I obtain Vespucci?\n\n\nSee \nObtaing Vespucci\n\n\nHow can I install Vespucci on my Android device?\n\n\nJust download and install like any other app =)\n\n\nHow can I install Vespucci on the Android emulator?\n\n\nInstallation of the Vespucci APK is like any other APK.\nThere are plenty descriptions available (e.g. \n1 \n, \n2 \n, \n3 \n, \n4 \n)\n\n\nRunning Vespucci on \"old and small\" devices\n\n\nModern (0.8 and up) Vespucci versions have been tested and found to work on Android 2.2 and later,\nhowever older devices tend to have very limited memory and correspondingly the apps are allocated very small amounts of heap (this can be as low as 16MB). If you are trying to run Vespucci on such a device, particularly with 0.9.4 and later, the following hints should be helpful (ordered in decreasing order of importance):\n\n\n\n\nturn off any map overlay\n\n\nonly load small map areas and don't excessively use the incremental load facility\n\n\nturn off notes and photo overlay\n\n\nturn off name suggestions\n\n\ndon't add large presets\n\n\n\n\nCan't download data from OpenStreetMap servers\n\n\nIf it is not a connectivity issue you may be running in to the following problem: current Vespucci versions use https (encrypted connections) to connect to the OpenStreetMap servers, if you are running on an older Android version this may be failing due to problems the old devices have with more recent certificates. \n\n\nWorkaround: create a new non-https API entry (enter \"http://api.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/\" as API URL) and select that. Version 0.9.8 and later automatically adds such an entry so you will only need to select it. \n\n\n\"301 Moved Permanently\" error when trying to download\n\n\nThe OpenStreetMap API server you are using is likely redirecting http (non-encrypted) to https (encyrpted) connections. Try changing the API configuration to use https.\n\n\nWhat can I do with the editor?\n\n\nCurrently, you can\n\n\n\n\nAdd and move nodes, ways and relations\n\n\nRotate ways\n\n\nEdit the tags of nodes, ways and relations\n\n\nAppend nodes to existing ways\n\n\nDelete existing nodes, ways and relations\n\n\nMerge nodes\n\n\nEdit existing relation mambers and add new \n\n\nAdd turn restrictions\n\n\nDownload area around current location from OSM server\n\n\nDownload user-specified areas from OSM server\n\n\nCreate, save, upload and import GPS tracks\n\n\n\n\nand much more.\n\n\nDoes Vespucci support OSM Notes?\n\n\nYes, Vespucci supports manual and automatic download of Notes and offline storage of them, further it supports displaying and editing warnings produced by the OSMOSE quality assurance system. OpenStreetBugs is no longer supported.\n\n\nWhat are the limits of Vespucci?\n\n\nSome things missing at this point in time\n\n\n\n\nNo validator (however in general Vespucci tries to stop you from shooting yourself in the foot)\n\n\nSome operations still missing, mainly polygon merging and relation sorting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember, Android is intended to be lightweight and easy-to-use.\n\n\n\n\nWhich languages are supported?\n\n\nThe user interdace is currently available in: English, German, Chinese (Taiwan), Spanish, Ukranian, Russian, Turkish, French, Italian, Vienamese, Chinese, Icelandic, Greek, Portugeses and Janpanese. These translations are typically complete or only have a small number of terms missing.\n\n\nWe also have partial translations for a number of other languages (please see link to transifex below for the current status). Any help in this area would be gratefully received. Please see \n.\n\n\nHow can I download OSM data?\n\n\nOn the first time startup, Vespucci requests which area to download. You can choose from the following options:\n\n\n\n\nCurrent location\n\n\nLast known location\n\n\nCoordinates. If you need access to specific geographic coordinates you can specify latitude/longitude.\n\n\nSearch for a location (New in 0.9.4, requires network connectivity)\n\n\n\n\nFor all download options, the additional parameter \"Radius\" is used. It specifies how large the downloaded area is. (In detail: Radius is half the side length of the bounding box that is used when  downloading.)\n\n\nYou can alternatively dismiss the dialog, zoom and pan to the area in question and then select the \"Download current view\" from the transfer menu.\n\n\nHow can I upload new/changed data to the OSM server?\n\n\nChoose \"Upload data to  OSM server\" from the transfer menu.\n(With other words: Data is not automatically uploaded!)\n\n\nWhich user account is used when uploading data to the OSM server?\n\n\nVespucci will use OAuth authorization as default for new installs. On your first upload you will be directed to an OSM page that we ask you to authorize your Vespucci install. It is not necessary nor recommended to store username/password on your device (it is however possible if OAuth causes problems for whatever reasons).\n\n\nNote: OAuth will work for both the standard API and the development servers, if you are running your own or need to access a third party site with OAuth you need to add the corresponding secrets to the API configuration and rebuild Vespucci.\n\n\nHow can I zoom into an area?\n\n\n\n\nUse the pinch-to-zoom multi-touch gesture.\n\n\nUse the on-screen zoom controls.\n\n\nUse the volume buttons of your Android device.\n\n\n\n\nConflict resolution\n\n\nvespucci has a built in conflict resolution capability. If you want finer grain control over the resolution process you can export all your changes to a .osc file, open that with JOSM and use JOSMs conflict resolution capabilities.",
