You will need the ActionBarSherlock library, which in turn requires the "android support" library.

You can find the android support lib in your SDK folder in extras/android/compatibilty/v4
I have also included the annotations.jar from android-sdk/tools/support, I don't know if it's required.

ActionBarSherlock can be obtained at https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock/ or http://actionbarsherlock.com/
You need to import the ActionBarSherlock project into your workspace and set it up as a prerequisite for Vespucci.
(the JAR alone is NOT sufficient)
