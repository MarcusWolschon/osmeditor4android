Selected elements can be moved by dragging in the touch area. Individual objects can be selected / de-selected by tapping them.

## Actions  

### ![](../images/undolist_undo.png) Undo

Tapping the icon once will undo the last operation. A long press will display a list of the operations since the last save, if you have undone anything a corresponding "redo" action will be displayed. If the undo results in the current selected object being removed you will be returned to the main screen. *Some operations consist of multiple simpler actions that will be listed as individual items.*

Remove the object from the data.

### ![](../images/relation.png) Create relation
