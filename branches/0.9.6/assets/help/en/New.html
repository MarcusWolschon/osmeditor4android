This is the main way to add new nodes, ways and OSM Notes in Vespucci. At the place were you touched the screen you will see a cross marker.</p><p>You can now do one of three things:</p><ul><li><strong>touch in the same place again</strong> - this will add a node at the location and start the tag editor. If the location is within the tolerance zone of a way it will be added as a new node to that way.</li><li><strong>touch some other place on the screen</strong> - this will create a way from the initial location to this location, the way acan be further extended by adding further node. Touching the last location completes the way and starts the tag editor. </li><li><strong>select a menu item</strong> see below</li></ul><p>Both the last node and the complete way can be moved without leaving "New" mode.</p><h2 id="Furtheractions">Further actions</h2><h3 id="..imagesaddress.pngAddaddresstags"><img alt="" border="0" src="../images/address.png"/> Add address tags</h3><p>Adds a node at the current location and adds address tags with prediction.
