# Presets

Vespucci supports JOSM compatible presets and the default preset and (not particularly pretty) icons are the same as JOSM. Just as with JOSM you can add further presets or use a different one than the default.

To manage the presets go to the "Preferences" screen and then to the "Advanced Preferences", selecting "Presets" will give you a list of the currently available presets. Clicking in the check box will enable/disable the corresponding entry, a long press on the entry (except for the default "OpenStreetMap") will give you a choice of 


* **Edit** - change the name or/and URl of the preset
* **Delete** - remove this entry
* **Update** - re-download the preset *(requires network connectivity)*

**Add preset** will add a new preset, you need to supply an URL and a name. Vespucci will download the preset file and any icons referenced by URL. *(requires network connectivity)*

Most current JOSM presets can be found in this list [http://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Presets](http://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Presets) Prests in a ZIP archive are currently not supported.
