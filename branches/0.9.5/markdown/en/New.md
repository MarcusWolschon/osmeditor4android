# New

After a long press on the map on the main screen you will enter the "New" mode. This is the main way to add new nodes, ways and OSM Notes in Vespucci. At the place were you touched the screen you will see a cross marker.

You can now do one of three things:

* **touch in the same place again** - this will add a node at the location and start the tag editor. If the location is within the tolerance zone of a way it will be added as a new node to that way.
* **touch some other place on the screen** - this will create a way from the initial location to this location, the way acan be further extended by adding further node. Touching the last location completes the way and starts the tag editor. 
* **select a menu item** see below
