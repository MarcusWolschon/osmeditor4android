All the translatable text in Vespucci has been concentrated into one file per language called 'strings.xml'.

There are strings elsewhere in Vespucci that would be nice to be translated, but it is currently technically difficult to make them available. The background layer descriptions are one example.

== transifex ==

The translations are managed on transifex: https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/vespucci/

NOTE: for building we assume for now that the SVN repository contains the current language files, if you are adding or changing strings it is your responsibility to retrieve current translations and check them in.

Currently transfex polls the strings.xml in the 0.9 branch for changes, once the branch is merged into trunk that should change to the trunk version. 

=== setting up transifex locally and retrieving translations ===

==== install ====

get the transifex tx tool see http://support.transifex.com/customer/portal/articles/995605-installation

the repository already includes a suitable .tx directory with config file, if that does not work for you do the following

	in your OSMEditor directory execute

	tx init

	tx set --auto-local -r vespucci.main "res\values-<lang>\strings.xml" --source-lang en --source-file res\values\strings.xml
	(my installation is on a windows machine on *IX "\" -> "/")

	this command will generate a list of tx commands but not do anything, normally adding --execute would be enough to complete the installation however due to the special mapping for "cs" it is a tiny bit more involved:

 	* exceute all the commands from the list with exception of the one that specifies the mapping for "cs"
 
 	* execute tx set -r vespucci.main -l cs res\values-cs-rCZ\strings.xml 
 
 ===== retrieving current translations ====
 
 tx pull -a
 
 will retrieve all translations configured above, skipping up to date translation files
  
 NOTE you will have to check if new translations have been added due to the "cs" issue and add such mappings manually if they haven't already been included in the tx config file
