# Edit relation members

This action mode allows interactively creating and editing a relations members by selecting them from the map. Elements that can be added will be highlighted and are clickable.

Points to note

- you can click on an element that is already a member, you will then be asked if you want to add ot remove it from the relation.
- if you click on a member that has multiple possible roles, you will be shown a modal that allows you to choose the role for the element.
- if you long click on an element it will be removed directly.

If an existing member element is selected that doesn't match a the member expressions defined in the relevant preset you will see a warning. The reason for this is that once you exit
the action mode you will no longer be able to add it back directly.
