## Vespucci 0.9.6 Highlights
2015-06-23

#### Multi-Select mode, currently supports
 * Deleting
 * Moving
 * Creating a relation from the selected elements
 * Tag editing on multiple objects
 * Merging multiple ways
  
Multi-select mode can be entered either by double-tapping an element (or a 2nd element if one is already selected) or via a menu item. The mode can be exited by double-tapping an empty area or by the usual other ways of exiting an action mode.  

#### Restyled tag editing with split pane layout on tablets.
* Selective tag copy, cut and paste. Tag copy and paste copy to the system clipboard a multi-line textual representation. Paste from clipboard will either set tag values from a multi-line text clip (for example from a OCR app) or use the clip if in the same textual representation to create key-value tupels.  

#### Relation editing improvements
 * Highlight elements of selected relations in a different color than selected elements
 * Allow adding of relations to relations directly
 * Select all members of a relation
