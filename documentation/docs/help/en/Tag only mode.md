# Tag only mode

_Tag only_ mode can be selected either be a long press on the lock button, by the using the _Modes_ menu from the overflow main menu, or by starting the app from the corresponding shortcut. In tag only mode geometry changes, for example moving and deleting elements, are not possible, however you can change element tagging and create new objects.

Selecting an element will immediately start the property editor and allow you to edit the elements tagging, double tapping will start a reduced functionality _multiselect_ mode that supports starting the property editor on multiple elements (functionality available with version 20.2 and later).
