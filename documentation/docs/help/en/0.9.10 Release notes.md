# Vespucci 0.9.10 BETA Highlights
 
## Configurable validator
 
The internal validator has been re-factored, among many other changes there is now a check for missing keys and the check for resurveying introduced in 0.9.9 is now fully configurable.

The missing tag check works on the combination of the configured keys that should be checked and the preset for element.

Example: the default configuration checks that a "name" tag is present on a object if the matching preset contains a "name" field in the non-optional tags, optionally the check can be extended to "optional" tags.

## C-Mode

In C-Mode only objects that have warnings are displayed, making it simple to find objects with missing tags and other potential problems. Starting the property editor for an object in C-Mode will automatically apply the best match presets.

Currently C-Mode is accessed by cycling through the modes via long press on the "Lock" button. This will likely be replaced by an alternative mechanism for release.
