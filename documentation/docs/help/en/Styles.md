# Styles

Vespucci supports an XML format style definition format that can control nearly every aspect of the map data rendering. You can find more information on the format on the [Vespucci website](https://vespucci.io/tutorials/data_styling/).

# Managing styles

To manage the styles go to the "Preferences" screen, selecting "Data style" will give you a list of the currently available styles. Clicking in the check box will enable/disable the corresponding entry, a long press on the entry or a press on the menu icon will give you for custom styles a choice of:

* **Edit** - change the name or/and URL of the style.
* **Delete** - remove this entry
* **Update** - re-download the style *(requires network connectivity)*
 
Note that the 5 pre-installed styles cannot be deleted and you will only get a menu entry **View** as their configuration cannot be changed.

The **+** button will add a new style, you will need to supply an URL for the file containing the style and a name or select a style file (click the SD-card icon) that is available on your device. Vespucci will download the style and any icons referenced by URL in the file, styles contained in a ZIP-archive are supported too. *(requires network connectivity for downloading)*
