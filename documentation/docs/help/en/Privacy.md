* Vespucci automatically adds an indication of the app version ( __created_by__ changeset tag), the background imagery used ( __imagery_used__ changeset tag) and the locale (language) setting of your device ( __locale__ changeset tag). This information is currently visible to anybody visiting the openstreetmap.org website or processing changeset data.
* The vespucci.io site and the Vespucci source code repository and issue tracker is hosted on [github (likely in the USA)](https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/) the developers have no access to any data on use of the site, IP addresses or similar.
* Crash dumps contain IP addresses, detailed information on your device and log information from your device immediately before the crash. This information is stored on a server operated by Simon Poole and located in Germany, when you submit a report. The information is deleted after 90 days if it is not required further for issue identification and resolution, general web server logfiles are retained for 15 days. None of this data is shared with 3rd parties. Processing of this data is based on a legitimate interest of the developers see [GDPR Art 6.(1) f)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/).
* Contributions uploaded to and other use of the OpenStreetMap API are subject to the [OSMF privacy policy](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy).
* Use of background, overlay and other layers will result in your device connecting to the [JOSM project](https://josm.openstreetmap.de) and the sites of the respective operators. More information on the provenance of such layers can be found on [JOSM Imagery Sources](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Maps).
* Using the Tasks layer can result in your device connecting to the OSMOSE QA service operated by [OpenStreetMap France](http://openstreetmap.fr/).
* Accessing the OpenAerialMap catalogue and retrieving imagery from the service will transmit your IP address and other information to its operator, which might be governed by this [privacy policy](https://www.hotosm.org/privacy).
