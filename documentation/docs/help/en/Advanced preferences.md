# Advanced preferences

The Advanced preferences page is split in to seven topical sections that can be access by clicking on the main entries. Depending on the Android version running on your device some settings may be not available for technical reasons.

## User Interface Settings

### Show node icons

Show icons on nodes if they can be matched with a preset. Default: _on_.

### Show POI icons on buildings

Show icons on buildings if the tags on the building can be matched with a preset. Default: _on_.

### Display tag form

Enable the form based tag editor. Default: _on_.

### Display labels from presets

Display labels from presets in the tag form editor. Default: _on_.

### Show camera action

Show a camera button on the main display (if a camera app is present). Default: _on_.

### Camera app

Select the camera app to use. If your, installed, camera app is not listed, please report this and we will add it to the list. Unluckily google does not allow to automatically determine installed camera apps outside of pre-installed ones. Default: _System default_.

### Use the MediaStore

Additionally use Androids MediaStore for accessing photos. This will add all photographs in JPEG format found via the MediaStore that contain coordinates in their EXIF data to the phto layer. Default: _off_.

### Follow location button layout

Change the side of the display the "Follow location" button is positioned on or remove it completely. Default: _lefthand side_.

### Always dim non-downloaded areas

If on the non-downloaded areas will be dimmed when the screen is locked. Default: _off_.

### Fullscreen mode

On devices without hardware buttons Vespucci can run in full screen mode, that means that "virtual" navigation buttons will be automatically hidden while the map is displayed, providing more space on the screen for the map. Depending on your device this may work well or not.  

In _Auto_ mode we try to determine automatically if using full screen mode is sensible or not, setting it to _Force_ or _Never_ skips the automatic check and full screen mode will always be used or always not be used respectively. _No statusbar_ will additionally try to remove Androids status bar besides forcing full screen mode.

On devices running Android 11 or higher the _Auto_ mode will never turn full screen mode on as Androids gesture navigation provides a viable alternative to it. 

Default on Android 4.4 - 10:0: _Auto_, 4.0 - 4.3 and 11.0 and later: _Never_. 

You need to restart the app for changes to this setting to take effect.

### Map screen orientation

If set to any other value than _Auto_ Vespucci will try to override your device settings for screen rotation.

### Show tolerance

Show halos indicating the size of the "touch areas" around elements. Default: _on_.

### Use back key for Undo

### Theme

Select the theme to use. _Follow system_ will follow the setting in the system preferences as far as possible, _Light_ and _Dark_ will fix the setting on the respective theme. _Follow system_ is only available on Android 10 and later. Default: _Follow system_. You need to restart the app for changes to this setting to take effect.

### Enable split action bar

Show the menu buttons at the bottom of the screen. Default: _on_. You need to restart the app for changes to this setting to take effect.

### App language

Select a language for the user interface that is different from the device default, setting the value to _Device language_ will revert to using your preference for the whole device. On devices running Android 13 and later the app language can be changed in the system settings too. Preset translations can be disabled in the preset configurations. 

### Max. number of inline values

Maximum number of values that will directly be displayed in the form based editor for Tags with pre-determined values. Default: _4_.
