# Main Vespucci Screen

The main Vespucci map screen is your normal starting point for interacting with the application. It can be in two modes

####  ![Locked](../images/locked.png) locked
In this mode modifying the OpenStreetMap data is disabled, you can however use all the menus and other functions, for example down- or up-load data. The main reason to use this mode is to pan and zoom in high density areas, or to avoid accidental changes when pocketing your device. 

Tapping the lock icon will toggle the lock.

####  ![Unlocked](../images/unlocked.png) unlocked
In this mode you can add and change the geometry and tags of OpenStreetMap data. *You will still need to zoom until editing is enabled.*

If a small "T" is displayed on the lock icon you are in "Tag editing only" mode and will not be able to change geometries, a small "I" indicates indoor mapping mode. A long press on the icon will display a menu allowing you to switch between editing modes, for mode switching purposes it dosen't matter if the display in "locked" or "unlocked".

All the mode options are 

* __Normal__ conventional editing mode.
* __Tag only__ selecting an object will immediately start the property editor.
* __Address__ slightly simplified dedicated mode for surveying addresses.
* __Indoor__ indoor editing with level selector.
* __C-Mode__ "complete" mode, only objects with validation warnings will be shown.

The lock icon will always be located in the upper left corner of your devices screen. The placement of the following controls will depend on the size, orientation and age of your device, and may be in the top or bottom bar, or in a menu. 

### Map and Data display

Once you have downloaded some OSM data you will see it displayed over a configurable background layer. The default background is the standard "Mapnik" style map provided by openstreetmap.org, however you can choose a different background or none from the Preferences. The style of the OSM data displayed on top of the background layer can be fully customized, however the standard "Color round nodes" or for "Pen round nodes" should work for most situations, the latter has smaller "touch areas" mainly for working with a pen. Depending on the device it may however work better for you than the default.

Note: the map tiles are cached on device and only deleted if explicitly flushed. In principle you can pre-download the tiles for the area you want to work on and so spare yourself the need to access them online while outside. 

### Layer control

Vespucci currently supports a tiled background imagery layer, a tiled overlay layer, a grid/scale layer, a task layer, a photo layer, a GeoJSON layer, a GPX/GPS layer and, naturally, an OSM data layer. Tapping the layer control (upper right corner) will display the layer dialog).

Currently it is not possible to change the ordering or add more than one layer of a specific type. The layer dialog supports the following: 

* Hide/Show button turns drawing of the layer off/on. Hiding a layer doesn't free any resources associated with the layer.
* Zoom to extent. Zooms and pans the screen so that the whole extent of the layer is displayed, if the extent cannot be determined this will zoom out to the full web-mercator coverage. Note: on the data layer this may not be particularly useful if you have downloaded areas that are far apart.
* Menu button.
    * Tile based layers: 
        * __Select imagery__ Same contents as the corresponding preference screen, if multiple layers have been used, a most-recently-used list will be displayed above this menu entry, allowing quick layer switching. Selecting the "None" entry from the list will disable the layer, and requires re-enabling it via the "+" button on the layer dialog.
        * __Add imagery from OAM__ Query OAM for layers in the current map view and display a list allowing to add them to the local configuration
        * __Flush tile cache__ Flush the on device cache for this layer.
        * __Background properties__ Set contrast of layer.
        * __Info__ Display information on the currently selected imagery.
    * GeoJSON layer. 
        * __Change style__ Show the layer styling dialog.
        * __Discard__ Delete the layer including any saved state.
    * GPX layer. The GPX layer is currently mainly controlled via the entries in the GPS menu.
        * __Change style__ Show the layer styling dialog.
    * Photo, Grid and Task layers.
        * __Configure...__ (for the Grid and Task layers)
        * __Disable__ Turn this layer off. For the tasks and photo layers this will free resources if the app is exited and re-started.
    * Data layer.
        * __Configure...__ Allows selection and configuration of the current OSM data sources. Same contents as the corresponding preference screen.
    * Data and Tasks layers.
        * __Prune__ remove downloaded data from storage that is outside of the current screen.
* __+__ button:
    * for disabled layers it will show a corresponding "Add ..." entry that will turn the layer on.
    * Load GeoJSON layer. Loads a GeoJSON layer from a file, any existing one will be replaced.

Besides the background layer you can add a "overlay" layer between the background and the OSM data, for example a layer showing buildings without an address.

### Highlighting of data issues

With the standard map style certain data issues will be highlighted in magenta, these are

* objects with 'fixme' and 'todo' tags (case insensitive)
* ways with 'highway=road'
* ways with 'highway' set to one of: motorway, motorway_link, trunk, trunk_link, primary, primary_link, secondary, secondary_link, tertiary, residential, unclassified, living_street and no 'name' or 'ref' tag
* relations with no 'type' tag
* certain points of interest that haven't been edited or verified lately. Default time that must have past since the last edit is 1 year.  
* untagged ways that are not a member of a relation
* unconnected highway end nodes, if the end nodes a near to a highway object that they could be connected to, the node is highlighted

### Indoor mode
   
In indoor mode the displayed level can be changed with the up/down buttons, tapping the level display button will show suitable objects that doesnâ€™t have a level tag, tapping again will revert to the level selector.

Elements that are not on the current level are drawn in a light grey, this works best on an uncluttered background map, for example the Thunderforest Landscape map. Newly created elements will automatically have the current level assigned in the property editor.

## Available Actions

### ![Undo](../images/undolist_undo.png) Undo
