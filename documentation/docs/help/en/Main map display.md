# Main Vespucci Screen

The main Vespucci map screen is your normal starting point for interacting with the application. It can be in two modes

####  ![Locked](../images/locked.png) locked
In this mode modifying the OpenStreetMap data is disabled, you can however use all the menus and other functions, for example down- or up-load data. The main reason to use this mode is to pan and zoom in high density areas, or to avoid accidental changes when pocketing your device. 

Tapping the lock icon will toggle the lock.

####  ![Unlocked](../images/unlocked.png) unlocked
In this mode you can add and change the geometry and tags of OpenStreetMap data. *You will still need to zoom until editing is enabled.*

If a small "T" is displayed on the lock icon you are in "Tag editing only" mode and will not be able to change geometries, a small "I" indicates indoor mapping mode. A long press on the icon will display a menu allowing you to switch between editing modes, for mode switching purposes it dosen't matter if the display in "locked" or "unlocked".

All the mode options are 

* __Normal__ conventional editing mode.
* __Tag only__ selecting an object will immediately start the property editor.
* __Address__ slightly simplified dedicated mode for surveying addresses.
* __Indoor__ indoor editing with level selector.
* __C-Mode__ "complete" mode, only objects with validation warnings will be shown.

The lock icon will always be located in the upper left corner of your devices screen. The placement of the following controls will depend on the size, orientation and age of your device, and may be in the top or bottom bar, or in a menu. 

### Map and Data display

Once you have downloaded some OSM data you will see it displayed over a configurable background layer. The default background is the standard "Mapnik" style map provided by openstreetmap.org, however you can choose a different background or none from the Preferences. The style of the OSM data displayed on top of the background layer can be fully customized, however the standard "Color round nodes" or for "Pen round nodes" should work for most situations, the latter has smaller "touch areas" mainly for working with a pen. Depending on the device it may however work better for you than the default.

Note: the map tiles are cached on device and only deleted if explicitly flushed. In principle you can pre-download the tiles for the area you want to work on and so spare yourself the need to access them online while outside. 

### Layer control

Vespucci currently supports multiple tiled background imagery layers, multiple tiled overlay layers (both raster and Mapbox vector tiles), a grid/scale layer, a task layer, a photo layer, multiple GeoJSON layers, multiple GPX/GPS layers and, naturally, an OSM data layer. Tapping the layer control (upper right corner) will display the layer dialog).

The layer dialog supports the following actions on the layer entries: 

* Hide/Show button turns drawing of the layer off/on. Hiding a layer doesn't free any resources associated with the layer.
* Zoom to extent. Zooms and pans the screen so that the whole extent of the layer is displayed, if the extent cannot be determined this will zoom out to the full web-mercator coverage. Note: on the data layer this may not be particularly useful if you have downloaded areas that are far apart.
* Menu button.
    * Tile based layers: 
        * __Select imagery__ Show a imagery selection dialog, if multiple layers have been used, a most-recently-used list will be displayed above this menu entry, allowing quick layer switching. 
        * __Flush tile cache__ Flush the on device cache for this layer.
        * __Background properties__ Set contrast of layer.
        * __Info__ Display information on the currently selected imagery.
    * Custom imagery tile based layers (additionally to the above):
        * __Edit custom imagery configuration__ edit the configuration of the imagery, for example the URL.
    * Mapbox Vector Tile layers (additionally to _Tile based layers_):
        * __Change style__ Show the layer styling dialog (disabled if a style has been loaded).
        * __Load style__ Load a mapbox-gl style.
        * __Reset style__ Reset the style to the default.
    * GeoJSON layers: 
        * __Change style__ Show the layer styling dialog.
        * __Info__ Display some information on the contents.
    * GPX layers:
      Starting recording by the "Start GPX track" item in the GPS menu will add a layer for the recording. Layers for GPX files and downloaded tracks from the OSM API can be added via the __+__ button, see below.  
        * __Change style__ Show the layer styling dialog.
        * __Go to start of GPX track__ Center the display on the start of the track. *(not available on the recording layer)*
        * __Go to first waypoint__ Center the display on the first waypoint. *(not available on the recording layer)*
        * __Upload GPX track__ Upload the track to the OSM API.
        * __Export GPX track__ Export the track to a local file.
        * __Start playback__ Playback the current file, this behaves similar to recording tracks, the display will be centered on the current track point, then the following on and so on. *(not available on the recording layer)*
        * __Pause playback__ Temporarily pause the playback. *(not available on the recording layer)*
        * __Stop playback__ Stop the playback. *(not available on the recording layer)*
    * Photo, Grid and Task layers:
        * __Configure...__ (for the Grid and Task layers)
        * __Disable__ Turn this layer off. For the tasks and photo layers this will free resources if the app is exited and re-started.
    * Data layer:
        * __Configure...__ Allows selection and configuration of the current OSM data sources. Same contents as the corresponding preference screen.
        * __Info__ Display some information on the contents.
    * Data and Tasks layers:
        * __Prune__ remove downloaded data from storage that is outside of the current screen and unmodified.
    * All layers:
        * __Discard__ Delete the layer including any saved state.
        * __Up__ move the layer up, potentially obscuring data from lower layers.
        * __Down__ move the layer down.
* __+__ button:
    * for disabled layers that can only be displayed once it will show a corresponding "Enable ..." entry that will turn the layer on.
    * __Add GeoJSON layer__ Loads a GeoJSON layer from a file in to a new GeoJSON layer.
    * __Add background imagery layer__ Adds a tile based imagery layer from the internal configuration, which can be from ELI or JOSM, or a custom imagery layer.
    * __Add overlay imagery layer__ As above but assumes that the layer is partially transparent.
    * __Add layer from GPX file__ Adds a layer from a GPS file on device.
    * __Download GPS track__ Download a GPX file from the OSM API for the user and create a layer from it. Note that only GPX tracks with their starting point in the area currently displayed will be available for selection, this is a limitation of the current OSM API.
    * __Add custom imagery__ Adds a custom imagery configuration, this can then be used just 
      as any tile based imagery source, the entries can be managed in the [preferences](Preferences.md).
    * __Add layer from MVT style__ Load a Mapbox-GL style file that has a "sources" section and create a layer. 
    * __Add imagery from OAM__ Add a layer from the OpenAerialMap catalogue. *(requires network connectivity)*
    * __Add imagery from WMS__ This allows you to add a specific layer from a WMS endpoint. *(requires network connectivity)*

Custom tile layers, including on device MBTile containers can be added in the [preferences](Preferences.md) 
or as decribed above..

### Highlighting of data issues

With the standard map style certain data issues will be highlighted in magenta, these are

* objects with 'fixme' and 'todo' tags (case insensitive)
* ways with 'highway=road'
* ways with 'highway' set to one of: motorway, motorway_link, trunk, trunk_link, primary, primary_link, secondary, secondary_link, tertiary, residential, unclassified, living_street and no 'name' or 'ref' tag
* relations with no 'type' tag
* certain points of interest that haven't been edited or verified lately. Default time that must have past since the last edit is 1 year.  
* untagged ways that are not a member of a relation
* unconnected highway end nodes, if the end nodes a near to a highway object that they could be connected to, the node is highlighted

### Indoor mode
   
In indoor mode the displayed level can be changed with the up/down buttons, tapping the level display button will show suitable objects that doesnâ€™t have a level tag, tapping again will revert to the level selector.

Elements that are not on the current level are drawn in a light grey, this works best on an uncluttered background map, for example the Thunderforest Landscape map. Newly created elements will automatically have the current level assigned in the property editor.

## Available Actions

### ![Undo](../images/undolist_undo.png) Undo

Tapping the icon once will undo the last operation. A long press will display a list of the operations since the last save, if you have undone anything a corresponding "redo" checkpoint will be displayed. *Some operations consist of multiple simpler actions that will be listed as individual items.*

### ![Camera](../images/camera.png) Camera

Start a camera app, add the resulting photograph to the photo layer is enabled. The photograph itself should be stored in the Vespucci/Pictures 
directory, however this depends on the specific camera app.

### ![Location](../images/menu_gps.png) Location

The "on-map" GPS button duplicates the function of the "Follow GPS position" menu entry. When this is activated the GPS arrow will be displayed as an outline. Note that the _Show location_ function will enable location updates from the system, just as the recording and similar options.
To reposition or remove the "on-map" GPS button use the "Follow position button layout" Preference.
