# Indoor mode
   
_Indoor_ mode can be selected either be a long press on the lock button or by the using the _Modes_ menu from the overflow main menu. In indoor mode the displayed level can be changed with the up/down buttons, tapping the level display button will show suitable objects that donâ€™t have a level tag, tapping again will revert to the level selector.

Elements that are not on the current level are drawn in a light grey, this works best on an uncluttered background map, for example the Thunderforest Landscape map. Newly created elements will automatically have the current level assigned in the property editor.
