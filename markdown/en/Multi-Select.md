# Multi-Select

Selected elements can be moved by dragging in the touch area. Individual objects can be selected / de-selected by (single) tapping them. A double tap in an entry area will end the mode.

## Actions

A long press will display a list of the operations since the last save, if you have undone anything a corresponding "redo" action will be displayed.
