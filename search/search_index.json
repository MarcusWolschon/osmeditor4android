            "text": "Vespucci Introduction\n\n\nVespucci is a full featured OpenStreetMap editor that supports most operations that desktop editors provide. It has been tested successfully on Google's Android 2.3 to 7.0 and various AOSP based variants. A word of caution: while mobile device capabilities have caught up with their desktop rivals, particularly older devices have very limited memory available and tend to be rather slow. You should take this in to account when using Vespucci and keep, for example, the areas you are editing to a reasonable size. \n\n\nFirst time use\n\n\nOn startup Vespucci shows you the \"Download other location\"/\"Load Area\" dialog. If you have coordinates displayed and want to download immediately, you can select the appropriate option and set the radius around the location that you want to download. Do not select a large area on slow devices. \n\n\nAlternatively you can dismiss the dialog by pressing the \"Go to map\" button and pan and zoom to a location you want to edit and download the data then (see below: \"Editing with Vespucci\").\n\n\nEditing with Vespucci\n\n\nDepending on screen size and age of your device editing actions may either be accessible directly via icons in the top bar, via a drop down menu on the right of the top bar, from the bottom bar (if present) or via the menu key.\n\n\n\n\nDownloading OSM Data\n\n\nSelect either the transfer icon \n or the \"Transfer\" menu item. This will display seven options:\n\n\n\n\nDownload current view\n - download the area visible on the screen and replace any existing data \n(requires network connectivity)\n\n\nAdd current view to download\n - download the area visible on the screen and merge it with existing data \n(requires network connectivity)\n\n\nDownload at other location\n - shows a form that allows you to enter coordinates, search for a location or use the current position, and then download an area around that location \n(requires network connectivity)\n\n\nUpload data to OSM server\n - upload edits to OpenStreetMap \n(requires authentication)\n \n(requires network connectivity)\n\n\nAuto download\n - download an area around the current geographic location automatically \n(requires network connectivity)\n \n(requires GPS)\n\n\nFile...\n - saving and loading OSM data to/from on device files.\n\n\nNote/Bugs...\n - download (automatically and manually) OSM Notes and \"Bugs\" from QA tools (currently OSMOSE) \n(requires network connectivity)\n\n\n\n\nThe easiest way to download data to the device is to zoom and pan to the location you want to edit and then to select \"Download current view\". You can zoom by using gestures, the zoom buttons or the volume control buttons on the device.  Vespucci should then download data for the current view. No authentication is required for downloading data to your device.\n\n\nEditing\n\n\n\n\nLock, unlock, mode switching\n\n\nTo avoid accidental edits Vespucci starts in \"locked\" mode, a mode that only allows zooming and moving the map. Tap the \n icon to unlock the screen. \n\n\nA long press on the lock icon will display a menu currently offering 4 options:\n\n\n\n\nNormal\n - the default editing mode, new objects can be added, existing ones edited, moved and removed. Simple white lock icon displayed.\n\n\nTag only\n - selecting an existing object will start the Property Editor, a long press on the main screen will add objects, but no other geometry operations will work. White lock icon with a \"T\" is displayed.\n\n\nIndoor\n - enables Indoor mode, see \nIndoor mode\n. White lock icon with a \"I\" is displayed.\n\n\nC-Mode\n - enables C-Mode, only objects that have a warning flag set will be displayed, see \nC-Mode\n. White lock icon with a \"C\" is displayed.\n\n\n\n\nSingle tap, double tap, and long press\n\n\nBy default, selectable nodes and ways have an orange area around them indicating roughly where you have to touch to select an object. You have three options:\n\n\n\n\nSingle tap: Selects object. \n\n\nAn isolated node/way is highlighted immediately. \n\n\nHowever, if you try to select an object and Vespucci determines that the selection could mean multiple objects it will present a selection menu, enabling you to choose the object you wish to select. \n\n\nSelected objects are highlighted in yellow. \n\n\nFor further information see \nNode selected\n, \nWay selected\n and \nRelation selected\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble tap: Start \nMultiselect mode\n\n\nLong press: Creates a \"crosshair\", enabling you to add nodes, see below and \nCreating new objects\n\n\n\n\nIt is a good strategy to zoom in if you attempt to edit a high density area.\n\n\nVespucci has a good \"undo/redo\" system so don't be afraid of experimenting on your device, however please do not upload and save pure test data.\n\n\nSelecting / De-selecting (single tap and \"selection menu\")\n\n\nTouch an object to select and highlight it. Touching the screen in an empty region will de-select. If you have selected an object and you need to select something else, simply touch the object in question, there is no need to de-select first. A double tap on an object will start \nMultiselect mode\n.\n\n\nNote that if you try to select an object and Vespucci determines that the selection could mean multiple objects (such as a node on a way or other overlapping objects) it will present a selection menu: Tap the object you wish to select and the object is selected. \n\n\nSelected objects are indicated through a thin yellow border. The yellow border may be hard to spot, depending on map background and zoom factor. Once a selection has been made, you will see a notification confirming the selection.\n\n\nOnce the selection has completed you will see (either as buttons or as menu items) a list of supported operations for the selected object: For further information see \nNode selected\n, \nWay selected\n and \nRelation selected\n.\n\n\nSelected objects: Editing tags\n\n\nA second touch on the selected object opens the tag editor and you can edit the tags associated with the object.\n\n\nNote that for overlapping objects (such as a node on a way) the selection menu comes back up for a second time. Selecting the same object brings up the tag editor; selecting another object simply selects the other object.\n\n\nSelected objects: Moving a Node or Way\n\n\nOnce you have selected an object, it can be moved. Note that objects can be dragged/moved only when they are selected. Simply drag near (i.e. within the tolerance zone of) the selected object to move it. If you select the large drag area in the preferences, you get a large area around the selected node that makes it easier to position the object. \n\n\nAdding a new Node/Point or Way (long press)\n\n\nLong press where you want the node to be or the way to start. You will see a black \"crosshair\" symbol. \n\n If you want to create a new node (not connected to an object), click away from existing objects.\n\n If you want to extend a way, click within the \"tolerance zone\" of the way (or a node on the way). The tolerance zone is indicated by the areas around a node or way.\n\n\nOnce you can see the crosshair symbol, you have these options:\n\n\n\n\nTouch in the same place.\n\n\nIf the crosshair is not near a node, touching the same location again creates a new node. If you are near a way (but not near a node), the new node will be on the way (and connected to the way).\n\n\nIf the crosshair is near a node (i.e. within the tolerance zone of the node), touching the same location just selects the node (and the tag editor opens. No new node is created. The action is the same as the selection above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTouch another place. Touching another location (outside of the tolerance zone of the crosshair) adds a way segment from the original position to the current position. If the crosshair was near a way or node, the new segment will be connected to that node or way.\n\n\n\n\nSimply touch the screen where you want to add further nodes of the way. To finish, touch the final node twice. If the final node is  located on a way or node, the segment will be connected to the way or node automatically. \n\n\nYou can also use a menu item: See \nCreating new objects\n for more information.\n\n\nAdding an Area\n\n\nOpenStreetMap currently doesn't have an \"area\" object type unlike other geo-data systems. The online editor \"iD\" tries to create an area abstraction from the underlying OSM elements which works well in some circumstances, in others not so. Vespucci currently doesn't try to do anything similar, so you need to know a bit about the way areas are represented:\n\n\n\n\nclosed ways (*polygons\")\n: the simplest and most common area variant, are ways that have a shared first and last node forming a closed \"ring\" (for example most buildings are of this type). These are very easy to create in Vespucci, simply connect back to the first node when you are finished with drawing the area. Note: the interpretation of the closed way depends on its tagging: for example if a closed way is tagged as a building it will be considered an area, if it is tagged as a roundabout it wont. In some situations in which both interpretations may be valid, an \"area\" tag can clarify the intended use.\n\n\nmulti-ploygons\n: some areas have multiple parts, holes and rings that can't be represented with just one way. OSM uses a specific type of relation (our general purpose object that can model relations between elements) to get around this, a multi-polygon. A multi-polygon can have multiple \"outer\" rings, and multiple \"inner\" rings. Each ring can either be a closed way as described above, or multiple individual ways that have common end nodes. While large multi-polygons are difficult to handle with any tool, small ones are not difficult to create in Vespucci. \n\n\ncoastlines\n: for very large objects, continents and islands, even the multi-polygon model doesn't work in a satisfactory way. For natural=coastline ways we assume direction dependent semantics: the land is on the left side of the way, the water on the right side. A side effect of this is that, in general, you shouldn't reverse the direction of a way with coastline tagging. More information can be found on the \nOSM wiki\n.\n\n\n\n\nImproving Way Geometry\n\n\nIf you zoom in far enough on a selected way you will see a small \"x\" in the middle of the way segments that are long enough. Dragging the \"x\" will create a node in the way at that location. Note: to avoid accidentally creating nodes, the touch tolerance area for this operation is fairly small.\n\n\nCut, Copy \n Paste\n\n\nYou can copy or cut selected nodes and ways, and then paste once or multiple times to a new location. Cutting will retain the osm id and version. To paste long press the location you want to paste to (you will see a cross hair marking the location). Then select \"Paste\" from the menu.\n\n\nEfficiently Adding Addresses\n\n\nVespucci has an \"add address tags\" function that tries to make surveying addresses more efficient. It can be selected:\n\n\n\n\nafter a long press: Vespucci will add a node at the location and make a best guess at the house number and add address tags that you have been lately been using. If the node is on a building outline it will automatically add a \"entrance=yes\" tag to the node. The tag editor will open for the object in question and let you make any necessary further changes.\n\n\nin the node/way selected modes: Vespucci will add address tags as above and start the tag editor.\n\n\nin the tag editor.\n\n\n\n\nHouse number prediction typically requires at least two house numbers on each side of the road to be entered to work, the more numbers present in the data the better.\n\n\nConsider using this with the \nAuto-download\n mode.  \n\n\nAdding Turn Restrictions\n\n\nVespucci has a fast way to add turn restrictions. if necessary it will split ways automatically and ask you to re-select elements. \n\n\n\n\nselect a way with a highway tag (turn restrictions can only be added to highways, if you need to do this for other ways, please use the generic \"create relation\" mode)\n\n\nselect \"Add restriction\" from the menu\n\n\nselect the \"via\" node or way (only possible \"via\" elements will have the touch area shown)\n\n\nselect the \"to\" way (it is possible to double back and set the \"to\" element to the \"from\" element, Vespucci will assume that you are adding an no_u_turn restriction)\n\n\nset the restriction type\n\n\n\n\nVespucci in \"locked\" mode\n\n\nWhen the red lock is displayed all non-editing actions are available. Additionally a long press on or near to an object will display the detail information screen if it is an OSM object.\n\n\nSaving Your Changes\n\n\n(requires network connectivity)\n\n\nSelect the same button or menu item you did for the download and now select \"Upload data to OSM server\".\n\n\nVespucci supports OAuth authorization and the classical username and password method. OAuth is preferable since it avoids sending passwords in the clear.\n\n\nNew Vespucci installs will have OAuth enabled by default. On your first attempt to upload modified data, a page from the OSM website loads. After you have logged on (over an encrypted connection) you will be asked to authorize Vespucci to edit using your account. If you want to or need to authorize the OAuth access to your account before editing there is a corresponding item in the \"Tools\" menu.\n\n\nIf you want to save your work and do not have Internet access, you can save to a JOSM compatible .osm file and either upload later with Vespucci or with JOSM. \n\n\nResolving conflicts on uploads\n\n\nVespucci has a simple conflict resolver. However if you suspect that there are major issues with your edits, export your changes to a .osc file (\"Export\" menu item in the \"Transfer\" menu) and fix and upload them with JOSM. See the detailed help on \nconflict resolution\n.  \n\n\nUsing GPS\n\n\nYou can use Vespucci to create a GPX track and display it on your device. Further you can display the current GPS position (set \"Show location\" in the GPS menu) and/or have the screen center around and follow the position (set \"Follow GPS Position\" in the GPS menu). \n\n\nIf you have the latter set, moving the screen manually or editing will cause the \"follow GPS\" mode to be disabled and the blue GPS arrow will change from an outline to a filled arrow. To quickly return to the \"follow\" mode, simply touch GPS button or re-check the menu option.\n\n\nNotes and Bugs\n\n\nVespucci supports downloading, commenting and closing of OSM Notes (formerly OSM Bugs) and the equivalent functionality for \"Bugs\" produced by the \nOSMOSE quality assurance tool\n. Both have to either be down loaded explicitly or you can use the auto download facility to access the items in your immediate area. Once edited or closed, you can either upload the bug or Note immediately or upload all at once.\n\n\nOn the map the Notes and bugs are represented by a small bug icon \n, green ones are closed/resolved, blue ones have been created or edited by you, and yellow indicates that it is still active and hasn't been changed. \n\n\nThe OSMOSE bug display will provide a link to the affected object in blue, touching the link will select the object, center the screen on it and down load the area beforehand if necessary. \n\n\nFiltering\n\n\nBesides globally enabling the notes and bugs display you can set a coarse grain display filter to reduce clutter. In the \"Advanced preferences\" you can individually select:\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nOsmose error\n\n\nOsmose warning\n\n\nOsmose minor issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndoor mode\n\n\nMapping indoors is challenging due to the high number of objects that very often will overlay each other. Vespucci has a dedicated indoor mode that allows you to filter out all objects that are not on the same level and which will automatically add the current level to new objects created their.\n\n\nThe mode can be enabled by long pressing on the lock item, see \nLock, unlock, mode switching\n and selecting the corresponding menu entry.\n\n\n\n\nC-Mode\n\n\nIn C-Mode only objects are displayed that have a warning flag set, this makes it easy to spot objects that have specific problems or match configurable checks. If an object is selected and the Property Editor started in C-Mode the best matching preset will automatically be applied.\n\n\nThe mode can be enabled by long pressing on the lock item, see \nLock, unlock, mode switching\n and selecting the corresponding menu entry.\n\n\nConfiguring checks\n\n\nCurrently there are two configurable checks (there is a check for FIXME tags and a test for missing type tags on relations that are currently not configurable) both can be configured by selecting \"Validator preferences\" in the \"Preferences\". \n\n\nThe list of entries is split in to two, the top half lists \"re-survey\" entries, the bottom half \"check entries\". Entries can be edited by clicking them, the green menu button allows adding of entries.\n\n\nRe-survey entries\n\n\nRe-survey entries have the following properties:\n\n\n\n\nKey\n - Key of the tag of interest.\n\n\nValue\n - Value the tag of interest should have, if empty the tag value will be ignored.\n\n\nAge\n - how many days after the element was last changed the element should be re-surveyed, if a check_date field is present that will be the used, otherwise the date the current version was create. Setting the value to zero will lead to the check simply matching against key and value.\n\n\nRegular expression\n - if checked \nValue\n is assumed to be a JAVA regular expression.\n\n\n\n\nKey\n and \nValue\n are checked against the \nexisting\n tags of the object in question.\n\n\nCheck entries\n\n\nCheck entries have the following two properties:\n\n\n\n\nKey\n - Key that should be present on the object according to the matching preset.\n\n\nCheck optional\n - Check the optional tags of the matching preset.\n\n\n\n\nThis check works be first determining the matching preset and then checking if \nKey\n is a \"recommended\" key for this object according to the preset, \nCheck optional\n will expand the check to tags that are \"optional* on the object. Note: currently linked presets are not checked.\n\n\nFilters\n\n\nTag based filter\n\n\nThe filter can be enabled from the main menu, it can then be changed by tapping the filter icon. More documentation can be found here \nTag filter\n.\n\n\nPreset based filter\n\n\nAn alternative to the above, objects are filtered either on individual presets or on preset groups. Tapping on the filter icon will display a preset selection dialog similar to that used elsewhere in Vespucci. Individual presets can be selected by a normal click, preset groups by a long click (normal click enters the group). More documentation can be found here \nPreset filter\n.\n\n\nCustomizing Vespucci\n\n\nSettings that you might want to change\n\n\n\n\nBackground layer\n\n\nOverlay layer. Adding an overlay may cause issues with older devices and such with limited memory. Default: none.\n\n\nNotes/Bugs display. Open Notes and bugs will be displayed as a yellow bug icon, closed ones the same in green. Default: on.\n\n\nPhoto layer. Displays geo-referenced photographs as red camera icons, if direction information is available the icon will be rotated. Default: off.\n\n\nNode icons. Default: on.\n\n\nKeep screen on. Default: off.\n\n\nLarge node drag area. Moving nodes on a device with touch input is problematic since your fingers will obscure the current position on the display. Turning this on will provide a large area which can be used for off-center dragging (selection and other operations still use the normal touch tolerance area). Default: off.\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced preferences\n\n\n\n\nAlways show context menu. When turned on every selection process will show the context menu, turned off the menu is displayed only when no unambiguous selection can be determined. Default: off (used to be on).\n\n\nEnable light theme. On modern devices this is turned on by default. While you can enable it for older Android versions the style is likely to be inconsistent.\n\n\nShow statistics. Will show some statistics for debugging, not really useful. Default: off (used to be on).  \n\n\n\n\nReporting Problems\n\n\nIf Vespucci crashes, or it detects an inconsistent state, you will be asked to send in the crash dump. Please do so if that happens, but please only once per specific situation. If you want to give further input or open an issue for a feature request or similar, please do so here: \nVespucci issue tracker\n. If you want to discuss something related to Vespucci, you can either start a discussion on the \nVespucci Google group\n or on the \nOpenStreetMap Android forum",

The online editor \"iD\" tries to create an area abstraction from the underlying OSM elements which works well in some circumstances, in others not so. Vespucci currently doesn't try to do anything similar, so you need to know a bit about the way areas are represented:   closed ways (*polygons\") : the simplest and most common area variant, are ways that have a shared first and last node forming a closed \"ring\" (for example most buildings are of this type). These are very easy to create in Vespucci, simply connect back to the first node when you are finished with drawing the area. Note: the interpretation of the closed way depends on its tagging: for example if a closed way is tagged as a building it will be considered an area, if it is tagged as a roundabout it wont. In some situations in which both interpretations may be valid, an \"area\" tag can clarify the intended use.  multi-ploygons : some areas have multiple parts, holes and rings that can't be represented with just one way. OSM uses a specific type of relation (our general purpose object that can model relations between elements) to get around this, a multi-polygon. A multi-polygon can have multiple \"outer\" rings, and multiple \"inner\" rings. Each ring can either be a closed way as described above, or multiple individual ways that have common end nodes. While large multi-polygons are difficult to handle with any tool, small ones are not difficult to create in Vespucci.   coastlines : for very large objects, continents and islands, even the multi-polygon model doesn't work in a satisfactory way. For natural=coastline ways we assume direction dependent semantics: the land is on the left side of the way, the water on the right side. A side effect of this is that, in general, you shouldn't reverse the direction of a way with coastline tagging. More information can be found on the  OSM wiki .",

There have been some modest performance improvements in both data rendering and with respect to tile retrieval and rendering.\n\n\nGPX Waypoints\n\n\nAn imported GPX track can now include GPX way points. These can be selected and converted in to OSM Nodes either via manual selection of a preset, or via an automatic search of the term in the GPX \"type\" fields in the presets.\n\n\nImagery database, custom imagery, OAM and MBTiles\n\n\nAs you may know we use the \nEditor Layer Index\n for our background and overlay imagery configuration. Previously we re-read and re-parsed the configuration file on every start of vespucci, we now on initial start up and after upgrades store the configuration in a database. This improves start up time considerably. We've further added a method to download updated configuration directly from the Editor Layer Index site.\n\n\nStoring this information in a database was a prerequisite to creating a simple UI to allow custom imagery to be added (there is still a facility to include imagery configuration via a file). While we were at it, we've added support for layers in MBTile format for enhanced offline editing.\n\n\nMore information on the topic can be found on \nvespucci.io\n.\n\n\nWMS server support\n\n\n10.1 adds limited support for WMS servers that support \"web-mercator\" projection (EPSG:3857 or EPSG:900913). The requested tiles are 512px x 512px in size to reduce the load on the target servers a bit, still this should likely be used with restraint.\n\n\nOAM Support\n\n\nLayers provided via OAM can be added to the imagery configuration via a query to the OAM catalog.\n\n\nMBTiles\n\n\nMBTile files containing jpen og png imagery can now be used as custom imagery sources on device.\n\n\nImagery offsets\n\n\nThe way how we handle local offsets (contrary to such stored in the \nimagery offset database\n) has changed. While \nthese were always a bit persistent, it wasn't really clear when and how they would be re-applied or vanish. We now store per adjusted layer one set of offsets permanently, if the app is started with a view near (100m) the location of such an adjustment it will be automatically applied and a warning displayed, the same on background layer changes. This results in non-surprising behaviour: app restarts and pausing in the same location will not suddenly change imagery alignment, but doing so further away from the location will show the layer as is.\n\n\nThis is not intended to be a replacement for storing offsets in and retrieving them from the imagery offset database that allows a far finer degree of control.\n\n\nGeo-location sensitive validation\n\n\nWe've done some initial work on providing support for location sensitive validation, currently this is limited to missing \"mph\" units in speed tags in countries that use such units.\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n\n\n\nIn many situations when an empty relation can be created a dialog is shown asking how to proceed.\n\n\nIn high density areas node touch halos will be reduced as you zoom out.\n\n\n\n\nThe full change log is available \nhere\n\n\nKnown problems\n\n\nUpgrading from previous versions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe saved editing state file format has changed, please complete any edits before upgrading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom imagery files now need to follow the new geojson format and be named \nimagery.geojson\n .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor known problems with this build please see \nour issue tracker",

Google has removed 2.2 support from the libraries we use to provide backwards compatible support and there doesn't seem to be a way that we can replace them in any reasonable fashion. Even as is, we cannot use the latest version of these libraries that would match the Android version we are building against.\n\n\nAs Android 2.2 was released in May 2010, nearly 7 years ago, we hope that this change does not affect all too many users.\n\n\nIndoor mode\n\n\nLong pressing the lock icon will cycle through:\n\n\n\n\nNormal editing mode\n\n\nTag only mode\n\n\nIndoor editing mode\n\n\n\n\nIn indoor mode the displayed level can be changed with the up/down buttons, tapping the level display button will show everything that doesn\u2019t have a level tag (roughly, it is slightly more complicated than that). \n\n\nChanged \"Geometry Improvement Handle\" behaviour\n\n\nGeometry improvement handles on ways now work as they do with iD: \n\n\n\n\nSelect way\n\n\nDrag handle (default rendering is a red x)\n\n\nWay remains selected\n\n\nDrag handle\n\n\n.. and so on ...\n\n\n\n\nThe trade-off is that now more care has to be exercised when dragging ways.\n\n\nOpening hours editor\n\n\nOn devices with Android 3.1 and later, opening_hours, service_times and collection_times tags can be created and edited with a form interface. Opening hour strings will be auto corrected if possible. The UI for this is still in development, but is already very usable. More information can be found in the source code repositories \nOpeningHoursFragment\n  and \nOpeningHoursParser\n,\n\n\nTag based filter\n\n\nThe filter can be enabled from the normal main menu, the filter can then be changed by tapping the filter icon. More documentation can be found on device or \nhere\n.\n\n\nPreset based filter\n\n\nAn alternative to the above, objects are filtered either on individual presets or on preset groups. Tapping on the filter icon will display a preset selection dialog, similar to that used elsewhere in Vespucci. Individual presets can be selected by a normal click, preset groups by a long click (normal click enters the group).\n\n\nScripting\n\n\nPresets now support a \"javascript\" property that allows a script to manipulate tags, for example a \"check_date\" tag can be auto filled with the current date. An \nexample preset\n.  Outside of the use in presets, scripts can be run in an expanded mode via the \"JS Console\". This is currently of limited usefulness as there is no documentation, however it is intended to add that for future releases.\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n\n\n\nthe \"Find\" search function now supports Photon based geocoders. The default configuration of the OSMF Nominatim and Komoot's Photon instances can be changed in the advanced preferences.\n\n\npresets support a \"deprecated\" property that allows them to be matched for the map display and in the form-based tag editor, but they are not offered and found for new use.\n\n\nsupport for opening a photo viewer in a split window on Android N and later.\n\n\na lot of work has been done to make it easier to contribute to Vespucci, this includes migrating to the new standard Android project layout, making more operations available via gradle tasks and adding tests for a substantial part of the code.\n\n\ntimestamps are now retained on downloaded elements, the value is displayed in the info dialog \n\n\na small set of objects (shops, restaurants, etc) are checked for if their last edit or check_date tag is more than 1 year back, if this is the case the object is highlighted and an alert is generated.\n\n\nincreased maximum supported zoom so that very small objects can be drawn (please see Known Problems), at the equator the minimum width of the displayed map is now limited to roughly 3 meters compared to the previous 11 meters. \n\n\npopulate most recently used preset list from manually entered tags.\n\n\nthe 255 character length limit on tag key, value and relation member role values is now enforced in the editor, previously uploads with such data would fail. \n\n\n\n\nThe full change log is available \nhere\n\n\nKnown problems\n\n\n\n\nDue to a change in the way Android N handles URIs that reference on-device files it may not be possible to display photos that are on removable storage. The current workaround of this problem may not work on your device or go away in future Android versions. \n\n\nSome manipulations of very small objects (dimensions roughly 1 meter and smaller), in particular rotation, orthogonalisation and arranging in a circle will possibly not show good results due to the maximum resolution of OSM data which is roughly 1cm at the equator.\n\n\n\n\nUpgrading from previous versions\n\n\n\n\nThe saved editing state file format has changed, please complete any edits before upgrading.\n\n\nFor known problems with the beta build please see \nour issue tracker",

Dragging such a handle on a non-selected way will add a node at the location, selection tolerance is that same as for ways.\n\n\nExperimental fix to the \"fat finger problem\", by providing a large drag area for nodes when selected. This can be turned on in the preferences.\n\n\nUpdated presets and icons.\n\n\nImproved map styling\n\n\nAdded better handling of the tile cache: total cache size can be limited (see the advanced preferences) default is 100MB, if the cache becomes near full the least recently used tiles (from any provider) are removed. Further the tiles of the current provider can be flushed (resulting in a new download) by selecting on the main screen Menu-\nTools-\nFlush tile cache (note: this currently happens synchronously and can take quite a long time).\n\n\nUpdated \nTutorial\n\n\n\n\nVersion 0.9.2\n\n\n2013-10-20: Relation editing nearly feature complete.\n\n\n\n\nLots of issues resolved\n\n\nPreference to use back button for undo\n\n\nMade better profile/map style default\n\n\nRelation creation mode and add member to relation,\n\n\nPreference added to leave screen on as long as Vespucci is app on top.\n\n\nIncremental data download.\n\n\nSplit closed way mode.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 0.9.0\n\n\n2013-08-27: Major new features and change of default user interface. See \nRelationSupport\n for more information.\n\n\n\n\nLots of issues resolved\n\n\nInitial relation support\n\n\nOAuth support\n\n\nSome changes to the rendering were made. landuse and tracks now have separate rendering, house color was changed. The rendering is now user selectable the old \"everything black\" style is available as \"Default\", this one as \"Color\". Further styles can be added, but please be aware that the current implementation is not likely to be long lived.\n\n\nLong press on a preset in the tag editor will remove it from the preset list.\n\n\nAdded the trivial changes for basic Samsung multi window support\n\n\nMerging of ways now tries to preserve existing way ids and uses conventional tag merging logic\n\n\nReversing a way, either explicitly in EasyEdit mode or implicitly by merging ways with different directions, will now reverse direction dependent tags. If a oneway tag is present, the explicit reversing will not change the value of oneway, assuming that this was the point of reversing in the first place.\n\n\nReversing a \"non-reversible\" way will display a warning.\n\n\nReplaced OSM bugs support with support for the new Notes API (note the XML version of the Notes API still has some issues which is the reason for the \"unknown action\" string in the display)\n\n\nQuick way of re-enabling GPS following: The GPS marker will turn to white (default for now) when following and back to the standard blue when following has been turned off. Clicking/touching the marker will turn following back on. Initially the following still has to be turned on via the menu.\n\n\n\"old\" editing modes can be suppressed via a preference, default is to only show lock/unlocked symbol to switch from \"Move\" and \"EasyEdit\" mode\n\n\nMove/drag way\n\n\nCopy, cut and paste of nodes and ways\n\n\nExperimental geo-referenced photo layer. Vespucci will try to find photographs in DCIM, osmtracker, and Vespucci directories on internal and external storage.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 0.8.0\n\n\n2012-10-02: Version 0.8.0 is now available! It's been more than a year since 0.7.0 was released and we have lots of new features:\n\n\n\n\nNew Honeycomb style Action Bar user interface, even on pre-HC devices.\n\n\nNew EasyEdit editing mode that unifies all previous editing modes (which are still available) into one mode.\n\n\nSupport Undo/Redo.\n\n\nShow way direction.\n\n\nSupport way reversal and deletion.\n\n\nAdd JOSM preset support in tag editor, customisations can be added.\n\n\nWhen tracking position, the direction you're pointing/travelling is shown.\n\n\nExport GPS tracks as GPX files.\n\n\nTransfer/Other Location shows coordinates of last location.\n\n\nAllow installing to SD card.\n\n\nAllow nothing as a background, drop Osmarender.\n\n\nAllow downloaded data to be saved as a JOSM-compatible OSC file.\n\n\nAdd support for Croatian, Danish, Japanese, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, and Russian languages.\n\n\nAdd crash error reporting using ACRA.\n\n\nSupport alternate OpenStreetMap APIs.\n\n\nMany other bug fixes and improvements.",

Experimental fix to the \"fat finger problem\", by providing a large drag area for nodes when selected. This can be turned on in the preferences.  Updated presets and icons.  Improved map styling  Added better handling of the tile cache: total cache size can be limited (see the advanced preferences) default is 100MB, if the cache becomes near full the least recently used tiles (from any provider) are removed.

The rendering is now user selectable the old \"everything black\" style is available as \"Default\", this one as \"Color\". Further styles can be added, but please be aware that the current implementation is not likely to be long lived.  Long press on a preset in the tag editor will remove it from the preset list.  Added the trivial changes for basic Samsung multi window support  Merging of ways now tries to preserve existing way ids and uses conventional tag merging logic  Reversing a way, either explicitly in EasyEdit mode or implicitly by merging ways with different directions, will now reverse direction dependent tags. If a oneway tag is present, the explicit reversing will not change the value of oneway, assuming that this was the point of reversing in the first place.  Reversing a \"non-reversible\" way will display a warning.  Replaced OSM bugs support with support for the new Notes API (note the XML version of the Notes API still has some issues which is the reason for the \"unknown action\" string in the display)  Quick way of re-enabling GPS following: The GPS marker will turn to white (default for now) when following and back to the standard blue when following has been turned off.

The default background is the standard \"Mapnik\" style map provided by openstreetmap.org, however you can choose a different background or none from the Preferences. The style of the OSM data displayed on top of the background layer can be fully customized, however the standard \"Color round nodes\" or for \"Pen round nodes\" should work for most situations, the latter has smaller \"touch areas\" mainly for working with a pen.

In general is it best to avoid them happening, particularly in areas with lots of editing activity by downloading only small areas, refreshing them often and saving changes frequently.\n\n\nVespucci uploads modified and deleted elements one by one. Any conflicts detected will be related to the current element and will need to be resolved before the upload can be retried.

In such a case you will be presented with the options to cancel, use your local version or to overwrite your changes with whatever is on the server.\n\n\nIt is likely better, except if you have really important changes, to use the remote version.

There are some variants even between applications that in principle use the same system, which are noted for completeness sake below.\n\n\nThe placeholders have the general format of \n{\n \nplaceholder name\n \n}\n.\n\n\n{zoom}\n the zoom level\n\n\n{x}\n the x tile number\n\n\n{y}\n the y tile number\n\n\n{-y}\n the y tile number for sources using TMS tile numbering. \nELI\n, \niD\n,  \nVespucci\n\n\n{ty}\n alternative for the y tile number for sources using TMS tile numbering. \niD\n, \nVespucci\n\n\n{switch:a,b,c}\n rotating server selection (replace \na,b,c\n by the actual sub-domains). \nELI\n, \niD\n, \nVespucci\n\n\n{quadkey}\n used for Bing. \nVespucci\n\n\n{u}\n used for Bing. \niD\n\n\n{proj}\n projection for WMS servers. \nELI\n, \nVespucci (only in configuration files)\n\n\n{width}\n tile width for WMS servers. \nELI\n, \nVespucci\n\n\n{height}\n tile height for WMS servers. \nELI\n, \nVespucci\n\n\n{bbox}\n bounding box in \nproj\n coordinates for WMS servers. \nELI\n, \nVespucci\n\n\n{subdomain}\n reserved, used internally by \nVespucci\n\n\n\n\nA valid normal (non-Bing) URL for a tile server must contain at least at least \n{zoom}\n, \n{x}\n and one of \n{y}\n, \n{-y}\n or \n{ty}\n.\n\n\nA valid WMS server entry must contain at least \n{width}\n, \n{height}\n and \n{bbox}\n placeholders.

After you've selected an entry you will again be shown the custom imagery dialog. Note: we try to determine the maximum zoom level from the nominal resolution of imagery as stored in OAM, however we've seen a couple of wacky values for this (sub-milimeter) and you should check that the value is roughly correct before saving. \n\n\nMBTiles\n\n\nTo add a MBTiles layer, down/upload the MBTiles format file to your device, then go to the \nCustom imagery\n form as described above.

Particularly with the new preset driven tagging interface presets have become even more important and if you are writing presets yourself and want them to work well in Vespucci please keep on reading.\n\n\nPreset-Driven Tag-Editing in Vespucci\n\n\n\n\nFor the preset based editing to work Vespucci has to match the existing tags, including incomplete, key-only ones with the available presets. This is done in an iterative fashion: the best matching preset is found (weighting presets with fixed key-value tuples higher than such with variable values), then all tags that can be found in linked presets are added (no separate header displayed) and this process is repeated until their are either no tags left or no preset match can be found.  \n\n\nSupported JOSM Preset Elements and Attributes\n\n\nNote: this is loosely based on what \nJOSM claims\n to works, this may, and actually likely is, different from the actual implementation.

            "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\nWhat is Vespucci?\n\n\nVespucci is the first \nOpenStreetMap\n editor for Android.\nThat means: it is a light-weight, easy-to-use mapping tool on mobile Android devices.\n\n\nWhat is Vespucci NOT?\n\n\n\n\nVespucci is not primarily a mobile map-viewer. \n\n\nVespucci is not a mobile navigation solution. It does not feature any routing support.\n\n\nVespucci is not a full replacement for JOSM or other desktop editors, but nearly. It strives for maximum usability on mobile devices which are limited in many regards. \n\n\n\n\nI am already familiar with OSM editor xyz. Why should I use Vespucci?\n\n\nIf you are mapping for OSM and already have an Android device (or planning for this) then Vespucci could help in your mapping work. Data is acquired \"on site\" and uploaded to the OSM server. By entering data in your mobile device \"on the road\" you can save time because you do not have to upload GPS tracks to your home PC and work your way again through these.\nAdditionally, obscure OSM data can be verified easily and quickly \"on site\", data which is already available in OSM is not acquired again.\n\n\nWhat do I need to get started with Vespucci?\n\n\nYou need:\n\n\n\n\nAn Android device (or the emulator), note that Release 0.9.x has only been tested on Android 2.3 and later\n\n\nThe Vespucci APK file (available from Google Play and GitHub)\n\n\nSome familiarity with \nOSM Map features\n\n\nAn \nOSM account\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the status of Vespucci development?\n\n\nThe current Vespucci version is 10.0.\n\n\nIs Vespucci available for other mobile platforms?\n\n\nNo, with the exception of those that provide an Android compatible environment.\n\n\nHow can I obtain Vespucci?\n\n\nSee \nObtaining Vespucci\n.\n\n\nHow can I install Vespucci on my Android device?\n\n\nJust download and install like any other app =)\n\n\nWhich special permissions does Vespucci require?\n\n\n\n\nfine location (GPS): to be able to pan the map to your current position and generate GPX format tracks\n\n\nwrite to external storage: background imagery tiles are stored, if present, on external storage, removing this permission will make the background process that downloads tiles non-functional\n\n\n\n\nVespucci warning that it cannot write to an external SD card\n\n\nVespucci preferentially attempts to store aerial imagery data on an external SD card if present, this is slower but leaves expensive internal storage free. On some devices this seems to cause persistent issues that are not resolved by giving the app permissions to write to external storage. A potential workaround is to remove the SD card (if this works in your setup), and then run vespucci. If that works and background imagery is displayed you can reinsert the SD card and vespucci should continue to use the internal storage.\n\n\nHow can I install Vespucci on the Android emulator?\n\n\nInstallation of the Vespucci APK is like any other APK.\nThere are plenty of descriptions available (e.g. \n1 \n, \n2 \n, \n3 \n, \n4 \n)\n\n\nRunning Vespucci on \"old and small\" devices\n\n\nModern (0.8 and up) Vespucci versions have been tested and found to work on Android 2.3 (2.2 was last supported in version 0.9.8) and later,\nhowever older devices tend to have very limited memory and correspondingly the apps are allocated very small amounts of heap (this can be as low as 16MB). If you are trying to run Vespucci on such a device, particularly with 0.9.4 and later, the following hints should be helpful (ordered in decreasing order of importance):\n\n\n\n\nturn off any map overlay\n\n\nonly load small map areas and don't excessively use the incremental load facility\n\n\nturn off notes and photo overlay\n\n\nturn off name suggestions\n\n\ndon't add large presets\n\n\n\n\nCan't download data from OpenStreetMap servers\n\n\nIf it is not a connectivity issue you may be running in to the following problem: current Vespucci versions use HTTPS (encrypted connections) to connect to the OpenStreetMap servers, if you are running on an older Android version this may be failing due to problems the old devices have with more recent certificates. \n\n\nWorkaround: create a new non-HTTPS API entry (enter \"http://api.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/\" as API URL) and select that. 0.9.8 and later versions already have such an entry, you only need to activate it. \n\n\nNote that the same issue may apply to certain background and overlay layers.\n\n\n\"301 Moved Permanently\" error when trying to download\n\n\nThe OpenStreetMap API server you are using is likely redirecting HTTP (non-encrypted) to HTTPS (encrypted) connections. Try changing the API configuration to use HTTPS.\n\n\nWhat can I do with the editor?\n\n\nCurrently, you can:\n\n\n\n\nAdd and move nodes, ways and relations\n\n\nRotate ways\n\n\nEdit the tags of nodes, ways and relations\n\n\nAppend nodes to existing ways\n\n\nDelete existing nodes, ways and relations\n\n\nMerge nodes\n\n\nEdit existing relation members and add new \n\n\nAdd turn restrictions\n\n\nDownload area around current location from OSM server\n\n\nDownload user-specified areas from OSM server\n\n\nCreate, save, upload and import GPS tracks\n\n\n\n\n... and much more.\n\n\nDoes Vespucci support OSM Notes?\n\n\nYes, Vespucci supports manual and automatic download of Notes and offline storage of them, further it supports displaying and editing warnings produced by the OSMOSE quality assurance system. OpenStreetBugs is no longer supported.\n\n\nWhat are the limits of Vespucci?\n\n\nSome things missing at this point in time:\n\n\n\n\nNo validator (however in general Vespucci tries to stop you from shooting yourself in the foot)\n\n\nSome operations still missing, for example polygon merging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember, Android is intended to be lightweight and easy-to-use.\n\n\n\n\nWhich languages are supported?\n\n\nThe user interface is currently available in: English, German, Chinese (Taiwan), Spanish, Ukrainian, Russian, Turkish, French, Italian, Vietnamese, Chinese, Icelandic, Greek, Portuguese and Japanese. These translations are typically complete or only have a small number of terms missing.\n\n\nWe also have partial translations for a number of other languages (please see link to Transifex below for the current status). If the translation for your language is incomplete or missing, please feel free to request the language on Transifex and start translating. Any help in this area would be gratefully received. Please see \nVespucci's Transifex page\n to help.\n\n\nHow can I download OSM data?\n\n\nOn the first time startup, Vespucci requests which area to download. You can choose from the following options:\n\n\n\n\nCurrent location\n\n\nLast known location\n\n\nCoordinates. If you need access to specific geographic coordinates you can specify latitude/longitude.\n\n\nSearch for a location (New in 0.9.4, requires network connectivity)\n\n\n\n\nFor all download options, the additional parameter \"Radius\" is used. It specifies how large the downloaded area is. (In detail: Radius is half the side length of the bounding box that is used when downloading.)\n\n\nYou can alternatively dismiss the dialog, zoom and pan to the area in question and then select the \"Download current view\" from the transfer menu.\n\n\nHow can I upload new/changed data to the OSM server?\n\n\nChoose \"Upload data to  OSM server\" from the transfer menu.\n(With other words: Data is not automatically uploaded!)\n\n\nWhich user account is used when uploading data to the OSM server?\n\n\nVespucci uses OAuth authorization by default for new installations. On your first upload you will be directed to an OSM page where you will need to grant Vespucci permission to use your OpenStreetMap account. It is not necessary nor recommended to store username/password on your device (it is however possible if OAuth causes problems for whatever reasons).\n\n\nNote: OAuth will work for both the OSMT-operated standard API and the development servers, if you are running your own or need to access a third party site with OAuth you need to add the corresponding secrets to the API configuration and rebuild Vespucci.\n\n\nHow can I zoom into an area?\n\n\n\n\nUse the pinch-to-zoom multi-touch gesture.\n\n\nUse the on-screen zoom controls.\n\n\nUse the volume buttons of your Android device.\n\n\n\n\nConflict resolution\n\n\nVespucci has a built in conflict resolution capability. If you want finer grain control over the resolution process you can export all your changes to a .osm file, open that with JOSM and use JOSM's conflict resolution capabilities.\n\n\nCan't enter key with MessageEase\n\n\nWhen word prediction is turned on in MessageEase it causes issues entering text for keys in the \"Details\" tab, disabling word prediction allows it to work.\n\n\nWhy do I have to have GPS turned on?\n\n\nYou don't. You can return to the app and continue working by pressing the back button when the system asks you to turn on GPS (location based functions will not work). \n\n\nThe reasoning behind this is that we assume that typical use is an on the ground survey and that you will want your current position to be displayed on the map. As a result the standard behaviour is to ask you (once) on start up of the app to turn GPS on, you can however disable this in the \"Advanced Preferences\" in the GPS section, by setting the \"Leave GPS off\" preference. \n\n\nThe translation for language X is incomplete or wrong!\n\n\nVespucci is a community developed, open source, project. While not everybody will be able to contribute to the code, everybody should be able to work on the translations on \n\ntransifex\n. Translations in the app are updated typically once a month.  \n\n\nThe translation for the presets is broken!\n\n\nThe preset translations tend to be a work in progress and given that a large number (over 2'300) of terms have to be translates, many are incomplete. If you want to use an untranslated preset instead, you can install one via the help page for presets (link at the bottom of the page).\n\n\nPresets for military objects are missing!\n\n\nDue to the touchy situation having pre-defined presets for military objects on device could create you need to download them and install them yourself. You can find a link at the bottom of the preset help page.\n\n\nFullscreen mode doesn't work properly\n\n\nFullscreen mode on Android is a bit hit and miss (depending on Android version and device) as it is really designed for games and for apps without keyboard use. If the Android buttons are hidden, the standard Android way to show them, at least in recent Android versions, is a swipe from the bottom edge. \n\n\nIf fullscreen mode is causing issues for you, the best solution is to simply turn it off in the \"Advanced preferences\". \n\n\nVespucci is getting slower and slower\n\n\nAdding more data via the auto-download facility and/or the menu item \"Add current view to download\" increases the amount of the data retained in memory. Due to the way Android works this has to be saved and re-loaded in a number of situations, including, naturally, on restart of the app. Further certain operations that need to select a subset of the data in memory can be impacted by this slow down too. \n\n\nRecommended practice, if you no longer need the previously loaded data and have uploaded all edits, is to reset the data in memory by using the \"Download current view\" action.\n\n\nHow can I add a custom (aerial/satellite) imagery layer\n\n\nThe preferred method is to add your imagery source to \nthe editor layer index\n so that it can be used by all OpenStreetMap editors.\n\n\nHowever you can add a file 'imagery.json' containing custom sources in the legacy editor-layer-index format in the Vespucci folder on your device. See \nsample file on google drive\n.  \n\n\nWhy can't you provide technical support on the google play store review section\n\n\nThe google play store allows only one reply to a review with a maximum length of just 350 characters. If you believe that what you are experiencing is a clear malfunction please open a new issue on \ngithub\n, if you have questions or can't find how do a specific operation you can ask on the \nOpenStreetMap help site\n or one of the other OpenStreetMap communication channels. \n\n\n350 characters is 100 characters less than the text above.",
