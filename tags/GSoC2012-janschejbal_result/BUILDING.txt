You will need the ActionBarSherlock library, which in turn requires the "android support" library.

The code was tested with ABS 4.1.0 and support library revision 10.

You can find the android support lib in your SDK folder in extras/android/compatibilty/v4.
Link the JAR into the libs folder in Eclipse.
You may need to replace the outdated version in the ActionBarSherlock project with a current link.

I have also included the annotations.jar from android-sdk/tools/support, I don't know if it's required.

ActionBarSherlock can be obtained at https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock/ or http://actionbarsherlock.com/
You need to import the ActionBarSherlock project into your workspace and set it up as a prerequisite for Vespucci.
(the JAR alone is NOT sufficient)
